build.","startTime":"05:50","endTime":"05:52","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What we have here are a few different

Persona.","startTime":"06:02","endTime":"06:04","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The Persona is basically the user prompts that we're using to define an outbound agent or

description.","startTime":"06:34","endTime":"06:36","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just throw in some

outreach and then a call to action strategy.","startTime":"07:22","endTime":"07:27","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's just basically coming back to the idea of we want to convey the value of what our platform is doing and hopefully getting them into a 20 minute AI assessment.","startTime":"07:27","endTime":"07:40","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We have a global URL here.","startTime":"07:40","endTime":"07:42","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where our system's design is

Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The only thing I really want to focus on is just having a common objection.","startTime":"08:02","endTime":"08:06","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the big thing about sales or engaging with potential lead potential customers is overcoming their objections.","startTime":"08:07","endTime":"08:14","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we really try to.","startTime":"08:14","endTime":"08:16","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One thing that we've really done working with our clients is refining what these objections are refining how we might want an outbound agent or an inbound agent to respond to a specific objection depending on the goals of our clients.","startTime":"08:16","endTime":"08:28","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if I do this, I create a Persona.","startTime":"08:28","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Here we have Ava right here.","startTime":"08:35","endTime":"08:39","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We can view her and it's just like the basic information.","startTime":"08:39","endTime":"08:45","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But what I'm going to do is so this is our platform and you can do create Personas, everything like that.","startTime":"08:45","endTime":"08:50","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But we also have a set of APIs.","startTime":"08:50","endTime":"08:52","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And really what we're trying to do is work with our clients to enable using our system in their systems.","startTime":"08:52","endTime":"08:59","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And one way we're doing that right now is using High Level.","startTime":"08:59","endTime":"09:03","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So High Level is Just a CRM where you can do a lot of customization and you can build a lot of custom branching workflows that kind of allow you to build marketing sequences, email, sms, all of that, different communication channels.","startTime":"09:03","endTime":"09:18","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm going to use this to illustrate one way that you can leverage the mercury APIs to actually extract conversational context and use our managed agents to engage with people.","startTime":"09:18","endTime":"09:29","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm going to create just myself here as a contact in our dummy High Level sub account.","startTime":"09:29","endTime":"09:38","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I go down here, I just need to do some configuration to make sure that our automation is running properly.","startTime":"09:48","endTime":"09:53","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"These values here are important for actually sending the right data and actually connecting and having a successful API request.","startTime":"09:54","endTime":"10:03","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So just adding that in these will be populated as we go through.","startTime":"10:04","endTime":"10:11","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"10:12","endTime":"10:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This contact is all ready to go.","startTime":"10:15","endTime":"10:17","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I head over to our automation.","startTime":"10:19","endTime":"10:20","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is the workflows in High Level.","startTime":"10:21","endTime":"10:23","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is what we're using to connect, basically do the API requests.","startTime":"10:23","endTime":"10:26","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I come in here, I just need to make a quick update.","startTime":"10:27","endTime":"10:31","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You see here we got this branching automation.","startTime":"10:35","endTime":"10:41","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's basically what this is doing fundamentally is facilitating a conversation loop between the conversational context and the agent as managed in Mercury and the channel and the contact as managed in High Level.","startTime":"10:41","endTime":"10:56","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if I come in here, all I need to do is update this to make it the proper Persona External ID that I created in Mercury.","startTime":"10:59","endTime":"11:09","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I update that, I save it, come back here to the contact.","startTime":"11:12","endTime":"11:22","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"11:25","endTime":"11:26","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All I'm going to do is just add them into the automation refresh here.","startTime":"11:26","endTime":"11:55","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, and basically just to jump in like with one of the reasons we like High Level is we're able to duplicate these workflows and so like, and also it has really nice integration with sms.","startTime":"11:57","endTime":"12:09","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So one of the things that we can do now that we have this platform and one of the ideas behind it was all we have to do is duplicate the workflow and change that Persona ID and we have a whole new campaign and our clients can go in and like iterate.","startTime":"12:09","endTime":"12:21","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And test.","startTime":"12:21","endTime":"12:21","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And yeah, we can like spin up new campaigns and like very rapidly now.","startTime":"12:23","endTime":"12:28","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That was the goal.","startTime":"12:28","endTime":"12:29","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"12:30","endTime":"12:30","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So here we have the basic test, the first SMS coming through from the agent.","startTime":"12:30","endTime":"12:36","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm not so concerned about what this content says right now.","startTime":"12:36","endTime":"12:39","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm just trying to show that it's working end to end.","startTime":"12:39","endTime":"12:41","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I definitely would refine this to make it a little bit more exact.","startTime":"12:41","endTime":"12:45","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a little long winded for a first text, but it's just showing that okay, this contacts received this message from the agent.","startTime":"12:45","endTime":"12:53","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If I go over to my messenger.","startTime":"12:53","endTime":"12:54","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You guys aren't seeing this, but I'm going to respond.","startTime":"12:54","endTime":"12:56","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just going to respond with that objection.","startTime":"12:58","endTime":"12:59","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I had.","startTime":"12:59","endTime":"13:00","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I see they have AI agents in their tray.","startTime":"13:09","endTime":"13:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, we don't believe in building.","startTime":"13:13","endTime":"13:16","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Building with those.","startTime":"13:16","endTime":"13:17","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"13:18","endTime":"13:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'm with you on that kind of thing.","startTime":"13:18","endTime":"13:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"There's usually a reason for it though, because integrations are expensive, but yeah, usually they offer some sort of watered down thing that just doesn't kind of respond very well.","startTime":"13:21","endTime":"13:32","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"13:32","endTime":"13:33","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'm just, I've responded here.","startTime":"13:34","endTime":"13:36","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm worried about the agent sounding inauthentic and so we'll wait for this to process.","startTime":"13:36","endTime":"13:42","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this automation is.","startTime":"13:42","endTime":"13:44","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's going to wait for a few minutes to capture potentially multiple contact responses before it aggregates that message and sends it to Mercury.","startTime":"13:46","endTime":"13:55","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm just going to show you guys at a high level kind of what our requests are going over to Mercury and just if I.","startTime":"13:55","endTime":"14:03","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can quickly say the reason we do that is like one of our learnings from our first campaigns was sometimes you see people responding like, hey, sounds good, but wait, I can't talk right now in like separate messages.","startTime":"14:03","endTime":"14:14","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And like.","startTime":"14:14","endTime":"14:14","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So it's just about capturing like all that context in one thing.","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"14:18","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that's why we have this like branching structure versus just.","startTime":"14:18","endTime":"14:22","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's a limitation of high level.","startTime":"14:22","endTime":"14:25","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Understood.","startTime":"14:27","endTime":"14:28","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I got caught in that same understanding of how to make chatbots until I figured out a way around it.","startTime":"14:28","endTime":"14:32","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the platform is deterministic.","startTime":"14:32","endTime":"14:34","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's water folly, this thing.","startTime":"14:36","endTime":"14:38","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But if we come in here, we can see the custom code configuration that we're doing or the custom webhook configuration that we're doing to basically do the Mercury API request.","startTime":"14:40","endTime":"14:52","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this use case here is create first message.","startTime":"14:52","endTime":"14:56","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the way that you can distinguish that is you can generate the Persona message.","startTime":"14:57","endTime":"15:03","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this basically says, yes, I want the Persona that this request is coming in for to generate a message.","startTime":"15:04","endTime":"15:11","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then basically this here is the ability to append that message to Mercury's message bubble, which I'll show you in a second.","startTime":"15:13","endTime":"15:26","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But this request here can serve dual purposes.","startTime":"15:27","endTime":"15:31","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It can do a first message, which is a logical decision that we made in Mercury, like this message type decision that we've made.","startTime":"15:31","endTime":"15:38","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it can also do response messages.","startTime":"15:38","endTime":"15:40","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's not limited by.","startTime":"15:40","endTime":"15:41","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It can, it can handle multiple data points.","startTime":"15:43","endTime":"15:45","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So and the reason it can do that is because we have another use case down here which is basically the request that is sending the aggregated contact response message to Mercury.","startTime":"15:45","endTime":"16:03","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so this is we're not expecting the Persona to respond in this case, and we're not expecting a message to be generated.","startTime":"16:05","endTime":"16:11","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But because this automation is a loop, when the contact goes out and comes back in and hits that first request again, a response message will be generated and the flow of conversation will continue.","startTime":"16:12","endTime":"16:24","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"While we're waiting for the message to come back here, we'll just go over and we'll have a look at Mercury.","startTime":"16:25","endTime":"16:34","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So here we have Explore Conversations.","startTime":"16:35","endTime":"16:38","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is basically a tool that we're using to not only show the ongoing conversation that's happening between a contact, as it's now been created in Mercury from high level between the contact and the agent, but it's also a place to iterate on how you want your agent to generate like this responses you want your agent to generate depending on the prompting that you've inputted in Persona creation.","startTime":"16:38","endTime":"17:09","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it's kind of a.","startTime":"17:09","endTime":"17:11","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a tool for you to easily review what's going on in a live production conversation and then iterate on a agent that you haven't yet deployed to production from a conversational message content perspective.","startTime":"17:11","endTime":"17:25","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this is what we got right now.","startTime":"17:26","endTime":"17:27","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can see my contact came in.","startTime":"17:27","endTime":"17:29","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can see that external ID that I used to create the contact is now here.","startTime":"17:29","endTime":"17:35","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's just the way that it's the unique identifier in Mercury, even though it's sour high level.","startTime":"17:35","endTime":"17:40","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And we can see here that we also have AVA and just the high level Persona information.","startTime":"17:41","endTime":"17:48","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're just waiting for this to finish running.","startTime":"17:50","endTime":"17:53","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Maybe while we're waiting, I'll jump in and just show the other side of the evaluations and everything.","startTime":"17:54","endTime":"17:58","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Sure.","startTime":"17:59","endTime":"17:59","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"18:00","endTime":"18:00","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I'll take over for a moment.","startTime":"18:01","endTime":"18:02","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that was I guess, the sort of like conversation design side of things.","startTime":"18:03","endTime":"18:06","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then now I will show.","startTime":"18:06","endTime":"18:08","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I.","startTime":"18:09","endTime":"18:10","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Will show the agent intelligence piece.","startTime":"18:10","endTime":"18:14","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I've got a deployment here that's got a lot more features.","startTime":"18:16","endTime":"18:19","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"This is actually the docs.","startTime":"18:21","endTime":"18:22","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"This is the next version that I'm going to release.","startTime":"18:22","endTime":"18:25","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The demo was built on the previous version.","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:29","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Things have changed a little bit in the UIs.","startTime":"18:31","endTime":"18:33","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Now you can do batch operations like batch deletes and all this fun stuff, and you can manage things a bit more nicely than those cards.","startTime":"18:33","endTime":"18:39","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And now there's this whole evalu.","startTime":"18:40","endTime":"18:42","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"This was the.","startTime":"18:42","endTime":"18:43","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What was.","startTime":"18:43","endTime":"18:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What Graham was showing was the conversation design piece.","startTime":"18:43","endTime":"18:47","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It was also missing this skills, which skills are sort of like, you know, arbitrary things that you can add that are like, you know, sentiment analysis or code generation or like JSON parsing or knowledge Bases, all this type of stuff.","startTime":"18:47","endTime":"19:03","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And so that's one piece that wasn't in the other demo.","startTime":"19:03","endTime":"19:08","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then the other piece that I wanted to show what's like is the agent really the agent intelligence side is like this evaluations and monitoring thing.","startTime":"19:08","endTime":"19:16","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So looking at the sidebar here, we have like evals set up for like Personas and skills.","startTime":"19:16","endTime":"19:24","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I guess, you know, you can imagine the flow is first you sort of eyeball how your agent's looking in the conversation window that Graham showed, then you can actually run evals.","startTime":"19:24","endTime":"19:35","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And what we actually usually do is because things are non deterministic, we run evals at a sample size.","startTime":"19:35","endTime":"19:43","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So we could say, okay, we set up a test case, we want to validate the output has X amount of things against this.","startTime":"19:43","endTime":"19:51","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Say it's like, oh, I want to make sure that the skill is always containing this value or the skill is always finishing in this amount of time, or it always passes or passes in X amount of cases.","startTime":"19:52","endTime":"20:04","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You can put a sample size of 1000 in here and a confidence level and that will run a test.","startTime":"20:05","endTime":"20:11","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It'll do it in this very cool thing that probably going to go too far into the weeds here called a step function distributed map, which this is basically a system in AWS that allows you to run things in parallel.","startTime":"20:13","endTime":"20:28","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And it's fully serverless.","startTime":"20:28","endTime":"20:29","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I can spin up a thing that executes in this, run like 4000 jobs.","startTime":"20:30","endTime":"20:36","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It made 4000 OpenAI calls and it finished in.","startTime":"20:37","endTime":"20:41","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The total execution time for this was six minutes.","startTime":"20:41","endTime":"20:45","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What?","startTime":"20:46","endTime":"20:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's a beautiful thing.","startTime":"20:47","endTime":"20:49","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And it's serverless, so it scales up and down as you need it.","startTime":"20:49","endTime":"20:54","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So it only serverless infrastructure for calling.","startTime":"20:54","endTime":"21:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Serverless infrastructure.","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:01","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's right.","startTime":"21:01","endTime":"21:02","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I don't have like a server Anywhere running 247 that can.","startTime":"21:02","endTime":"21:06","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That is capable of running 4000 things.","startTime":"21:06","endTime":"21:09","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's just.","startTime":"21:09","endTime":"21:09","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You need to run 4000 things.","startTime":"21:09","endTime":"21:11","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"There you go.","startTime":"21:11","endTime":"21:12","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Six minutes done.","startTime":"21:12","endTime":"21:13","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I won't go too far into the weeds.","startTime":"21:14","endTime":"21:16","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Okay, cool.","startTime":"21:16","endTime":"21:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"We'll talk another time about it.","startTime":"21:17","endTime":"21:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"21:18","endTime":"21:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then.","startTime":"21:19","endTime":"21:19","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then the other thing that's really cool.","startTime":"21:20","endTime":"21:21","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you know, the other biggest learning that we had here is like, great, you eyeballed your conversations great.","startTime":"21:21","endTime":"21:29","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You ran your non deterministic evals to a point where you're like satisfied that like 90 of the times things are going well still if you're running things at scale, you want some kind of monitoring in there.","startTime":"21:29","endTime":"21:40","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So here, this is basically ongoing monitoring for conversations tied to a Persona.","startTime":"21:40","endTime":"21:48","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You can do different types of monitors, hallucination detection, sentiment Analysis, support escalation, like string analysis or just like custom prompts.","startTime":"21:48","endTime":"21:56","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And then for these you can set like an alerting threshold and you can send email alerts.","startTime":"21:57","endTime":"22:01","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So if you have like a pager set up, God forbid you're able to like page someone or just send an email report for this particular Persona that you want to be monitoring.","startTime":"22:01","endTime":"22:12","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you know that's just kind of, you need that for these non deterministic things.","startTime":"22:12","endTime":"22:16","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I'm going to share on the side here.","startTime":"22:17","endTime":"22:20","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"While this API and this platform is not publicly available, we are working on a community edition right now.","startTime":"22:22","endTime":"22:28","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We just deploy a separate instance and a separate database for individual clients because I've written it all as infrastructure, as code so I can just spin it up really easily.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:39","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But I'll put the docs in the chat here and maybe send it out after because these things tend to get lost.","startTime":"22:39","endTime":"22:46","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"If anyone's interested to have a read through that.","startTime":"22:47","endTime":"22:49","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And yeah, I rambled on a bit there.","startTime":"22:51","endTime":"22:54","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I will pass it back over to Graham.","startTime":"22:54","endTime":"22:55","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But yeah, if you're interested in that, just feel free to shoot me a message anywhere, email, whatever.","startTime":"22:57","endTime":"23:02","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Cool, thanks Spencer.","startTime":"23:06","endTime":"23:07","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just rounding out this, we can see that the conversation has come back and this flow can, will continue in perpetuity as long as the lead continues to respond.","startTime":"23:08","endTime":"23:19","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's it on the high level side.","startTime":"23:21","endTime":"23:23","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And if we refresh here, when you.","startTime":"23:23","endTime":"23:26","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Say the lead will continue, will it will continue on script and pulling from or continue?","startTime":"23:26","endTime":"23:32","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like how does it end?","startTime":"23:33","endTime":"23:35","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How do you know?","startTime":"23:35","endTime":"23:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It ends in three ways.","startTime":"23:37","endTime":"23:39","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if the lead continues to respond, the conversation will continue if the lead stops responding.","startTime":"23:39","endTime":"23:46","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because we're designing this around marketing sequences, we have mechanisms that will fire, bump or follow up messages from the agent at a set point in the future.","startTime":"23:46","endTime":"23:57","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that will happen a few times and then we'll say, okay, this person's not responding, let's end the conversation.","startTime":"23:59","endTime":"24:03","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's other mechanisms in place around what justifies closing the conversation prematurely.","startTime":"24:04","endTime":"24:10","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"One of those is if it's an SMS campaign and the person says this is the wrong number, we take that value.","startTime":"24:10","endTime":"24:15","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We immediately say this is a close conversation and that person is basically removed from the, on the high level side, from the workflow.","startTime":"24:15","endTime":"24:21","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"24:21","endTime":"24:22","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or if the person says like don't talk to me anymore, stop messaging me.","startTime":"24:22","endTime":"24:26","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's a clear indication we need to close this conversation.","startTime":"24:26","endTime":"24:29","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so we do that.","startTime":"24:30","endTime":"24:31","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But yeah, we can see this conversation is represented here as well for the end, for the user.","startTime":"24:32","endTime":"24:38","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well that's really cool.","startTime":"24:38","endTime":"24:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And it's Again, like, so this is, that's the end of the demo.","startTime":"24:41","endTime":"24:44","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But just to sum it up, like, we want to be able to enable people to effectively manage conversational context over time because we think that's like an essential data point that we can use to enable effective agents.","startTime":"24:44","endTime":"25:03","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the more that we bring our clients on board to Mercury via, you know, high level automations that we've enabled, and the more that we can get users leveraging our APIs in other to integrate with other systems and are finding practical value that this conversational context is really improving the agents that they're deploying.","startTime":"25:04","endTime":"25:23","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We see value in that.","startTime":"25:24","endTime":"25:25","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's what we're striving for.","startTime":"25:25","endTime":"25:27","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just to tag onto that, like also effective, efficient quality mechanisms for bringing a human into the loop when necessary, such as the monitoring system sending out an alert email if you see like, hey, 5% of your messages had like really negative sentiment or 5% of your messages, you know, like, weren't sending the call to Action link or whatever metrics that you care about so that you can go in, adjust the configuration and then, you know, rapidly deploy an updated version and like measure against it.","startTime":"25:30","endTime":"26:01","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, so there's integrations are always kind of, they're complex.","startTime":"26:01","endTime":"26:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so I'm wondering where you find your control planes in this.","startTime":"26:06","endTime":"26:11","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, I'm using that phrase a lot like these days because you can establish when like even your protocol is to me is the control plane.","startTime":"26:11","endTime":"26:19","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like the JSON protocol you said has more than one utility.","startTime":"26:19","endTime":"26:22","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It has even in its one structured piece.","startTime":"26:22","endTime":"26:24","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I'm just wondering how you see or where you see your control planes.","startTime":"26:25","endTime":"26:30","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I can take that one.","startTime":"26:31","endTime":"26:32","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So like, obviously we have the UI in which you configure like the actual Personas themselves and that's like the control plane for the content of the Persona.","startTime":"26:32","endTime":"26:44","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The endpoint that Graham showed, the webhook is really like an RPC endpoint where you're able to sort of do things on the fly.","startTime":"26:46","endTime":"26:54","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It has this notion of an external id.","startTime":"26:54","endTime":"26:56","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's to enable people who want to do workflows without having to go do a bunch of setup up front.","startTime":"26:56","endTime":"27:02","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Graham showed the configuration of the contact ID in like a manual step.","startTime":"27:02","endTime":"27:06","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But even that, if you already have your own external identifier, you don't need to do anything, you just need to pass all of that through.","startTime":"27:06","endTime":"27:12","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"The idea is the workflow themselves can be the control plane dynamically and that's just to produce the onboarding friction.","startTime":"27:12","endTime":"27:20","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What we didn't show here and was detailed in Those API docs is there is a full REST API for configuring everything in the background.","startTime":"27:20","endTime":"27:28","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So if you want to set up a platform, if you're more technically inclined or you have your own automations in place or web apps in place that you want to leverage this with, you can create your own control plane for it as well inside your applications.","startTime":"27:28","endTime":"27:42","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Does that, does that mostly answer your question?","startTime":"27:43","endTime":"27:45","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Oh, totally.","startTime":"27:45","endTime":"27:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not exactly.","startTime":"27:46","endTime":"27:47","speaker_name":"David

it's.","startTime":"27:51","endTime":"27:56","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's the fluid moving through the pipes and how you shape that.","startTime":"27:56","endTime":"28:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So you're so back in the day we call you packet shapers but you also have call to action all over the place.","startTime":"28:01","endTime":"28:07","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"28:09","endTime":"28:10","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, you've shown a whole lot of.","startTime":"28:10","endTime":"28:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Of the validation and eval component and how you have strategies around that and how you're trying to surface your stuff as the.","startTime":"28:13","endTime":"28:22","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like how I see it anyways, you surface your experience as the core point of contact and that the substrate, what you call it.","startTime":"28:22","endTime":"28:30","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I missed that a long time ago.","startTime":"28:30","endTime":"28:33","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I put up two blind eyes to CRMs and it's been a problem.","startTime":"28:33","endTime":"28:37","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what was the name of the CRM?","startTime":"28:39","endTime":"28:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That one's Go High Level.","startTime":"28:41","endTime":"28:42","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Go High Level and using it significantly, I think that's a pretty smart way to go.","startTime":"28:42","endTime":"28:49","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then figuring out.","startTime":"28:49","endTime":"28:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So how about this?","startTime":"28:50","endTime":"28:51","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Figuring out how to migrate your.","startTime":"28:52","endTime":"28:55","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Your stuff to a new platform will be a really interesting

make.","startTime":"29:05","endTime":"29:07","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's the point of the RPC API there.","startTime":"29:07","endTime":"29:10","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's just like, it's kind of one of the things that we started with here was like, okay, great.","startTime":"29:10","endTime":"29:15","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Our first implementations was really coupled to high level.","startTime":"29:15","endTime":"29:18","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"This was like how do we become CRM agnostic?","startTime":"29:18","endTime":"29:21","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that's one of the reasons that we developed this API.","startTime":"29:21","endTime":"29:25","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"29:26","endTime":"29:27","speaker_name":"Jason

crazy.","startTime":"30:49","endTime":"30:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Thanks for demos guys.","startTime":"30:53","endTime":"30:54","speaker_name":"David

channels.","startTime":"31:02","endTime":"31:05","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We haven't bridged that gap into voice yet.","startTime":"31:07","endTime":"31:09","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that high levels in SMS is using Twilio on.","startTime":"31:10","endTime":"31:15","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Okay on the underside and so they have a markup on SMS costs essentially it's like part of their usage based business model.","startTime":"31:15","endTime":"31:23","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So we're using high level in that instance for using SMS or using that

not.","startTime":"31:29","endTime":"31:31","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Doesn't end up at Twilio like is Twilio only

interested in it.","startTime":"31:40","endTime":"31:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, thank you for the demo.","startTime":"31:44","endTime":"31:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That was really cool.","startTime":"31:45","endTime":"31:46","speaker_name":"David

have a couple of questions on the user side because thank you for the demo.","startTime":"31:52","endTime":"31:57","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"This is super cool.","startTime":"31:57","endTime":"31:58","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I love that you can analyze the conversations afterwards to really think about how people are receiving your chatbots.","startTime":"31:58","endTime":"32:08","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So you can maybe fine tune them to customers of interest and to the type of people you want to capture.","startTime":"32:08","endTime":"32:16","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So that's super awesome.","startTime":"32:16","endTime":"32:17","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Couple of questions.","startTime":"32:17","endTime":"32:18","speaker_name":"Jen

gotten any feedback on that?","startTime":"32:25","endTime":"32:27","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"It's a spectrum.","startTime":"32:30","endTime":"32:31","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's geek level, there's some.","startTime":"32:34","endTime":"32:37","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's something smiling really loud.","startTime":"32:37","endTime":"32:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Tell us, tell us the two ends of the

Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But yeah, well like I guess in the early going it was a lot more obvious but we definitely had some agents that have made it.","startTime":"32:45","endTime":"32:53","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Some people know and some people call it out and then they're.","startTime":"32:55","endTime":"33:00","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're not engaged.","startTime":"33:00","endTime":"33:01","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Some people have very much responded with well to the experience and I think the reason that Is.","startTime":"33:01","endTime":"33:07","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is as we've evolved our design of how we're deploying these agents, we've also improved the personalization.","startTime":"33:07","endTime":"33:16","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the campaigns that were a lot more personalized and were actually calling out specific information about that contact, I don't think they really cared.","startTime":"33:16","endTime":"33:25","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They liked the fact that it was engaging for them and then it was facilitating the actions that we wanted them to take.","startTime":"33:26","endTime":"33:32","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"33:33","endTime":"33:33","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Maybe just to clarify something in this example, like were showing it for an AI agent platform, but like most of the time, and we provide our clients this option, the agents don't disclose that they are AI, even when asked.","startTime":"33:36","endTime":"33:52","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Sometimes people will say, oh, hey, I can tell you're AI or whatever.","startTime":"33:52","endTime":"33:56","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's gone down over time.","startTime":"33:57","endTime":"33:58","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But yeah, like, just to.","startTime":"34:00","endTime":"34:02","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Just to be clear, like, that's something that's an option we provide to the client.","startTime":"34:02","endTime":"34:05","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And like, unanimously, people have always chosen, don't reveal that it's AI, like, even when asked.","startTime":"34:05","endTime":"34:11","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Interesting, because like, that was.","startTime":"34:12","endTime":"34:14","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"That's a lead in for kind of.","startTime":"34:14","endTime":"34:15","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"My next question is thinking about trust and things like that.","startTime":"34:15","endTime":"34:20","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"You know, if you're a potential client and you're not told you're interacting with a bottle and then you find out like that too, I could see that putting a lot of people off.","startTime":"34:20","endTime":"34:32","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And I guess, I mean, to your point, it's up to the person who's using it to decide whether they want to disclose that up front or not.","startTime":"34:33","endTime":"34:43","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But it's, you know, as you're doing your demo, I found it so ironic that, you know, an AI bot is assuring someone that it's a whole essential, except for it's not revealing in the first place that it's an AI bot.","startTime":"34:45","endTime":"35:00","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"You know, a bit of a.

bot.","startTime":"35:14","endTime":"35:22","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Is that inauthentic, though, that it's.","startTime":"35:22","endTime":"35:25","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That it's not saying that it's a bot or not because we have amazing experiences with agents.","startTime":"35:25","endTime":"35:31","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is it Scooby morphic to think that you have to say I'm a bot?","startTime":"35:32","endTime":"35:35","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I don't know.","startTime":"35:35","endTime":"35:36","speaker_name":"Jason

lie about being a bot?","startTime":"35:39","endTime":"35:43","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I think that's inauthentic.","startTime":"35:43","endTime":"35:45","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"35:45","endTime":"35:46","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Like if you ask someone, are you a bot and they're a human, they're like, no, I'm a human.","startTime":"35:46","endTime":"35:50","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But if you ask a bot, are you a bot?","startTime":"35:50","endTime":"35:52","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And they're like, no, I'm not a

Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"That's just downright lying.","startTime":"35:54","endTime":"35:56","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"If the bot identifies as a human.","startTime":"35:59","endTime":"36:01","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like, are we not so.","startTime":"36:02","endTime":"36:04","speaker_name":"Jen

that.","startTime":"36:05","endTime":"36:06","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"In that text that you saw, let's set up a call together, right?","startTime":"36:06","endTime":"36:12","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So if someone says, sure, let's take a do that, do you now have a human agent who has to pretend their name's Ava?","startTime":"36:12","endTime":"36:17","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Because that's what the bot's name is, you know, like, yeah.","startTime":"36:18","endTime":"36:23","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I think you almost never have the agent being the one you're expected to have in the room.","startTime":"36:25","endTime":"36:31","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think if you extrapolate this out just a little bit, like six months, a year, the expectation of whether or not you're talking to a human or a bottle, it just diffuses.","startTime":"36:31","endTime":"36:41","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So this is maybe like a problem or a.","startTime":"36:42","endTime":"36:44","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It's an ethical thing now.","startTime":"36:45","endTime":"36:46","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And I totally get where your position is on that gent, but I think it's like, a bunch of stuff will happen and then no one will care and it won't matter.","startTime":"36:46","endTime":"36:54","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And so how much do we want to care and make it matter now?","startTime":"36:55","endTime":"36:59","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like, you guys see, like, Nano Banana
