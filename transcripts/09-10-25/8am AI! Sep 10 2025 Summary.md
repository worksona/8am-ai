## Overview

- Jason Kryski highlighted the potential for transcription analysis from his extensive 25-30 hour weekly meeting load, which could enhance insights derived from stored meeting data.
- James Giroday emphasized the critical need for establishing consent protocols before utilizing over 50 weeks of meeting transcripts to ensure ethical data usage.
- Jen Boger noted that consent complexities vary based on context and value propositions, particularly in indefinite research outcomes, stressing the need for tailored approaches.
- The group agreed to focus on consent frameworks for future meetings, opting not to apply them retroactively to past sessions.
- David Olsson presented programmatic consent management tools that allow for selective removal of participant or topic details from transcripts, enhancing privacy.
- The introduction of Chatham House Rules was proposed as a means to sanitize shared information while maintaining the richness of the discussion.
- Jason Kryski raised concerns that rigid consent structures might undermine trust and alter current inter-relational dynamics among participants.
- Ying advocated for a trust-based approach that emphasizes reputation over mere compliance, stressing the importance of behavior in consent agreements.
- James Giroday proposed a structured process for developing consent terms, including goal setting, collaborative writing, and voting on terms in three dedicated sessions.
- Jen Boger recommended a values-based framework for consent that encourages situational flexibility and includes a model for disclosing conflicts of interest among participants.

## Notes

##### üîç **Introduction and Context Setting** (00:00 - 01:27)
- Jason Kryski described his heavy meeting load of 25-30 hours per week, suggesting this creates enough corpus for transcription analysis.
- Ying introduced herself as a marketing professor at UBC Okanagan with computer science background, recently appointed as AI advisor, seeking to learn from industry practitioners.
##### üìù **Core Discussion: Consent Framework** (02:43 - 09:45)
- James Giroday led discussion on establishing consent protocols before leveraging the corpus of 50+ weeks of meeting transcripts.
- Group identified need to address consent and 'terms and conditions' before programmatic use of accumulated meeting content.
- Jen Boger emphasized consent complexity depends on context and value proposition, noting challenges in research environments where outcomes are undefined.
- Discussion clarified focus on consent for future meetings rather than retroactive application to past sessions.
##### üîß **Technical Solutions and Chatham House Rules** (14:12 - 18:19)
- David Olsson demonstrated programmatic consent management using My GPT tools that can remove individual participants or topics from transcripts.
- Introduced Chatham House Rules as formal framework for sanitizing information while preserving intelligence sharing.
- Showcased Coalesce tool for transcript analysis and persona generation with BBS-style continuation capabilities.
##### ‚öñÔ∏è **Trust vs. Structure Tension** (28:18 - 48:01)
- Jason Kryski expressed concern that formal consent structures might reduce trust and change interaction dynamics from current relational approach.
- Hanif Janmohamed emphasized value of relational web over extractive approaches, questioning the concept of 'leveraging corpus'.
- Ying advocated for trust-based approach rooted in reputation, noting consent documents cannot bind behavior if reputation isn't valued.
##### ü§ù **Collaborative Term Development Process** (32:35 - 34:43)
- James Giroday proposed three-session workflow: goal setting, collaborative term writing with chatbot assistance, and adoption voting.
- Suggested different consent levels for various session types: term writing, voting, or off-record discussions.
##### üí° **Values-Based Framework** (52:48 - 01:03:09)
- Jen Boger recommended values-based engineering approach rather than rigid rule structures, allowing case-by-case group consultation for boundary situations.
- Proposed conflict-of-interest disclosure model where participants declare potential trust conflicts to the group.
##### üì± **Technical Demonstration** (57:15 - 01:01:25)
- David Olsson showcased zero-to-hero app prompt generator for creating single-page web applications from transcripts, compatible with ChatGPT-5.
- Jen Boger suggested using AI tools to meta-analyze past conversations for generating initial values-based social contract draft.
