it.","startTime":"03:45","endTime":"03:48","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think that one of the main outcomes from it was, before we do much else, I think we need to

meetings.","startTime":"04:33","endTime":"04:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'm like, jammy, let's go

Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We already have a repo where we can put our things, we can put our transcripts in there.","startTime":"04:52","endTime":"04:56","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's my duty to do that is right now, is to put them into the repo so we all have access to it.","startTime":"04:56","endTime":"05:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then what?","startTime":"05:01","endTime":"05:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's where our meeting with the interesting title went.","startTime":"05:04","endTime":"05:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'm just providing some context to the fact that James has put a lot of thought around what it, you know, what it means for us to be able to have a surface area to play with.","startTime":"05:06","endTime":"05:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And this is the steps of getting there.","startTime":"05:18","endTime":"05:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is that good phrase?","startTime":"05:21","endTime":"05:22","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"05:23","endTime":"05:23","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That's amazing context.","startTime":"05:23","endTime":"05:24","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm trying to provide a bit of context for Ying and I feel like Jen has a fair bit of context and I think full of, you, Hanif and Jason kind of understand what we're trying to get to.","startTime":"05:24","endTime":"05:34","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But what I skipped over was like, so we're, we got these transcripts, we've got this corpus, and I feel like there's a million and one reasons why we would want to leverage it.","startTime":"05:34","endTime":"05:45","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But what became clear in this kind of goal setting session was I think before we do that, we need to talk about consent.","startTime":"05:46","endTime":"05:55","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Here's another really not fun terms and conditions.","startTime":"05:55","endTime":"05:59","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, I don't know, you just hear terms.","startTime":"06:00","endTime":"06:01","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm okay with terms, but conditions like everybody's like, yeah, let's leverage the corpus.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:07","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And everybody's like, terms and conditions.","startTime":"06:07","endTime":"06:08","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Boo.","startTime":"06:08","endTime":"06:09","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It sounds terrible.","startTime":"06:09","endTime":"06:11","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I don't want to read terms and conditions.","startTime":"06:11","endTime":"06:13","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So anyways, that's.","startTime":"06:14","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The first part is just kind of that consent piece, that consent goal.","startTime":"06:17","endTime":"06:21","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The second thing I wanted to go and do was maybe a roundtable and get your guys thoughts on whether or not this whole topic resonates at all and then maybe go through some of the thoughts that I was having on how to take a collaborative approach to writing terms and conditions or getting consent or whatever it is.","startTime":"06:21","endTime":"06:46","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So, yeah, pretty simple.","startTime":"06:46","endTime":"06:49","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I mean, I thought consent was maybe a simple topic and then I started thinking about it.","startTime":"06:49","endTime":"06:52","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's like, actually this is really complicated.","startTime":"06:52","endTime":"06:56","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"This is legal.","startTime":"06:56","endTime":"06:58","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm not a lawyer.","startTime":"06:58","endTime":"06:59","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So with that I'll maybe open it up to the group a little bit.","startTime":"07:00","endTime":"07:04","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It sounds like Jen had some thoughts.","startTime":"07:05","endTime":"07:07","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Do you want to start off before.","startTime":"07:07","endTime":"07:09","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Jen, Jason was, he was poking his hand up.","startTime":"07:09","endTime":"07:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I was after Jen.","startTime":"07:13","endTime":"07:14","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, sorry.","startTime":"07:14","endTime":"07:15","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All right.","startTime":"07:19","endTime":"07:20","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Flow.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:23","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"I don't want to interrupt what James is like talking about, but this is like, this is such a cool topic and I'm excited we're doing this.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:30","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And consent is hard, right?","startTime":"07:30","endTime":"07:32","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Because it depends what it is you're using and what you're using it for as to whether people will smile or frown.","startTime":"07:32","endTime":"07:39","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So I think context is a really big one in the consent piece.","startTime":"07:39","endTime":"07:44","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And we just think to like apps, right?","startTime":"07:44","endTime":"07:46","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It's the value of the app versus how invasive is it going to be on privacy as to whether you consent or not.","startTime":"07:46","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And it's like that balance.","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:55","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"What's interesting with researchy pieces is it's harder to describe what you're consenting to because you don't know what the output is going to be.","startTime":"07:55","endTime":"08:06","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So with an app, you actually have like the thing that you can then hold up and be like, well, how much do I value this and what exactly is it doing with my data?","startTime":"08:06","endTime":"08:14","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"If you read all that stuff, which I bet none of us do, or just like, sure, except whatever, like.","startTime":"08:14","endTime":"08:20","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But.","startTime":"08:21","endTime":"08:22","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So that's a tricky one where we can look at.","startTime":"08:23","endTime":"08:26","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"If nothing leaves the group, you consent to each piece.","startTime":"08:26","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"That kind of leaves the group.","startTime":"08:31","endTime":"08:33","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But in terms of playing around in a more secure sandbox, you just consent to people kind of going nuts.","startTime":"08:33","endTime":"08:40","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Except for people can't push stuff unless you know, the group consents to it, but then you run into, if half the group consents and the other half doesn't, now what do you do?","startTime":"08:40","endTime":"08:51","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"08:51","endTime":"08:52","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like, it's such a cool thing and.","startTime":"08:52","endTime":"08:54","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"08:54","endTime":"08:54","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And just another add into that, not just for the data piece, but for our conversations themselves.","startTime":"08:54","endTime":"09:00","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"09:01","endTime":"09:01","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like, there's been so many cool topics in this group where I'm like, I want to share with people, you know, about stuff we've talked about, because the ideas are really good and the conversations are really good.","startTime":"09:01","endTime":"09:14","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But I also want to make sure this is, like, a space where everyone feels they can be open and candid.","startTime":"09:14","endTime":"09:20","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And so that's the other one.","startTime":"09:20","endTime":"09:22","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"09:23","endTime":"09:24","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"That's a lot of thought.","startTime":"09:24","endTime":"09:24","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"09:28","endTime":"09:28","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"This is fun.","startTime":"09:28","endTime":"09:31","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I feel like.","startTime":"09:32","endTime":"09:33","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And we're talking just to clarify, like, the consent of the participants in this kind of session related to the corpus of the material that's been produced over that period of time.","startTime":"09:33","endTime":"09:44","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"09:44","endTime":"09:45","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Or moving forward.","startTime":"09:45","endTime":"09:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Moving forward.","startTime":"09:48","endTime":"09:48","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay, so.","startTime":"09:48","endTime":"09:50","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because, like, I would say, like, previously there was, like, an implied consent, you.","startTime":"09:50","endTime":"09:54","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Know, like, kind of maybe not.","startTime":"09:54","endTime":"09:56","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Well, I think early on, like, really early on, David had set some expectations around, like, Shadow House Rules.","startTime":"09:57","endTime":"10:03","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I think there's like, some.","startTime":"10:03","endTime":"10:05","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Again, like, it was really loose, you know, and, like, it's really variable.","startTime":"10:07","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because it's not always the same people on every call.","startTime":"10:10","endTime":"10:12","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It varies, you know, you may miss something.","startTime":"10:12","endTime":"10:14","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, that's not defined.","startTime":"10:14","endTime":"10:17","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But yeah, I just wanted to kind of clarify that.","startTime":"10:17","endTime":"10:21","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Moving forward.","startTime":"10:22","endTime":"10:22","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, moving forward.","startTime":"10:23","endTime":"10:24","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I mean, also, the consent, I think, is just to provide that sandbox kind of environment so that we don't want to clamp down with a ton of structure that makes coming to this conversation not very appealing.","startTime":"10:24","endTime":"10:37","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But if we can find an easy way of, you know, heading off issues in the future and making it more.","startTime":"10:38","endTime":"10:45","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Leaving more time for the play aspect of it, I think that's pretty

valuable because it allows you to analyze a conversation and say okay, if I take out an E flow it takes out these threads and you can't necessarily do that.","startTime":"16:52","endTime":"17:04","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well and you can't and you have a hard

conversation.","startTime":"18:47","endTime":"18:49","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Seems like the consent among this

yeah.","startTime":"18:55","endTime":"18:57","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The thing that we keep coming back to is the transcripts and it seems like there's a big, we all think that there might be a big benefit and a big value in having access to the transcripts, just the conversations, the creativity and the ideas.","startTime":"18:57","endTime":"19:13","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And to Hanif's point, sort of leveraging that corpus of transcripts.","startTime":"19:14","endTime":"19:20","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like now there's almost probably 50 or 60 of them and we've covered a lot.","startTime":"19:20","endTime":"19:27","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"There's a lot of interesting ideas actioning them.","startTime":"19:27","endTime":"19:30","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"We're probably, we're probably over a thousand at the moment.","startTime":"19:30","endTime":"19:34","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So that's kind of like the opportunity is the transcripts is being able to use them.","startTime":"19:36","endTime":"19:43","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The consent is, I mean that's, we've never talked about this before, so it's really a wide open topic.","startTime":"19:44","endTime":"19:52","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"19:53","endTime":"19:53","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So in terms of consent, I see this as two levels.","startTime":"19:53","endTime":"19:58","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"First one is why we need a consent and second level, it's execution of what we're going to do.","startTime":"19:58","endTime":"20:06","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"That I think it's better to have a really clear idea about why and then go into the details of how we going to execute.","startTime":"20:06","endTime":"20:16","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So from the why perspective I can see intellectual property, someone's ideas and we want to make sure that person will be credit if this idea is being taken outside the context and being used.","startTime":"20:16","endTime":"20:33","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So also there's a trade offs right?","startTime":"20:34","endTime":"20:37","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So for person who's.","startTime":"20:37","endTime":"20:40","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Who's have the intention to do that they should understand they may lose the future access to this group if they are not doing properly and that's the trade off right.","startTime":"20:40","endTime":"20:54","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So anyone want to take the risk and lose the whole intellectual connections and a pool of wisdom and expert.","startTime":"20:54","endTime":"21:04","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So I, I think that's like this is the value like the people who you have access to you can talk regularly is your assets.","startTime":"21:05","endTime":"21:17","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So I think if we clear about everyone's object like why we want to have consent then we can adopt a standard.","startTime":"21:18","endTime":"21:28","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"There must be a lot of standard consent that we can adopt and on the other hand is we don't need to be too.","startTime":"21:30","endTime":"21:39","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"I don't know like we also want to be mindful that I value this like whoever's in this group invalu this they probably your applied consent will work unless they just want to abandon this then no one can really stop that.","startTime":"21:41","endTime":"22:00","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Well, we value you.","startTime":"22:00","endTime":"22:01","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Ying, thanks for being here.","startTime":"22:01","endTime":"22:03","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think that the topic you brought up about standard terms is a really interesting one.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:09","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"What I started doing was considering well there's probably a way to get Claude to write some boilerplate legal stuff that's going to be 2,000 words and it's going to be never ever read once.","startTime":"22:10","endTime":"22:24","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So that's one way to do it.","startTime":"22:25","endTime":"22:27","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"What I thought was maybe a better way to also do it was include like a question and answer thing.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:33","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like some of the questions that I had were who writes the terms?","startTime":"22:33","endTime":"22:37","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like how do they get updated?","startTime":"22:38","endTime":"22:40","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Why is it needed?","startTime":"22:42","endTime":"22:43","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Which is kind of like to your point, can I withdraw my consent?","startTime":"22:43","endTime":"22:46","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"What does the consent apply to?","startTime":"22:46","endTime":"22:48","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Who gets access to the corpus and like how is it used?","startTime":"22:49","endTime":"22:53","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then how do the terms get adopted?","startTime":"22:55","endTime":"22:56","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So Jen, with that I'll pass it to you.","startTime":"22:56","endTime":"22:59","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"If you had something, you're on a roll, keep going.","startTime":"22:59","endTime":"23:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's what I've got so far.","startTime":"23:02","endTime":"23:03","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"There's eight questions.","startTime":"23:03","endTime":"23:04","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"These are all really good and you know the big one is if you don't consent then are you not allowed to participate in the group?","startTime":"23:05","endTime":"23:11","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So like just like apps, it's infuriating, right?","startTime":"23:12","endTime":"23:15","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"You either have to consent to.","startTime":"23:15","endTime":"23:17","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"They have all your data and are going to do who knows what with it or you don't use the app.","startTime":"23:17","endTime":"23:22","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"That's basically consent right now.","startTime":"23:22","endTime":"23:24","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And a lot of them, you're like, well, if I don't use this app, WhatsApp is a great example of my case.","startTime":"23:24","endTime":"23:32","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It's not my favorite, but it's the only one that goes across platforms nicely enough and our families all use it.","startTime":"23:32","endTime":"23:40","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So it's kind of like, you know, I'm not keen on it, but the value means I am giving all my data to Facebook, which doesn't make me happy at all.","startTime":"23:40","endTime":"23:53","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But, you know, it's like, what can we do?","startTime":"23:53","endTime":"23:57","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"23:57","endTime":"23:57","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like that's the type of thing.","startTime":"23:57","endTime":"23:58","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So with the group as well, I think that's the big question is if you, is it a case by case consent basis?","startTime":"23:58","endTime":"24:05","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So either Chattan has rules where it's kind of like we consent to whatever said in this conversation can be anonymized and used outside of this group for other stuff kind of thing, or are we doing case by case basis?","startTime":"24:06","endTime":"24:19","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And if it's the latter, then how are we going to allow people to review what's being used from them and make a choice?","startTime":"24:19","endTime":"24:28","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Because that gets a lot harder.","startTime":"24:28","endTime":"24:30","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"24:31","endTime":"24:31","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And, and how do what's like, who manages that process?","startTime":"24:31","endTime":"24:34","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And do you like, sit there and read through every bit of your transcript and decide?","startTime":"24:35","endTime":"24:41","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And I think it's important in this case more than a lot of others because of the size of the group.","startTime":"24:41","endTime":"24:47","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So to your question, Ying from before, like, why consent?","startTime":"24:47","endTime":"24:51","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"It's because there people are saying a lot of things in this group that's quite small that could arguably be reverse engineered out.","startTime":"24:51","endTime":"25:00","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And then it's like, oh, Jen said this thing and you know, publicly, would that be damaging besides the fact of, like, if you're making money off something I said, should I get a piece of royalty in your thing?","startTime":"25:00","endTime":"25:15","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So those are kind of the two.","startTime":"25:15","endTime":"25:16","speaker_name":"Jen

trust.","startTime":"28:31","endTime":"28:35","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Because in Asian society, there's no consent, there's no

that's basically put more robust boundary around each people's behavior.","startTime":"28:49","endTime":"28:56","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Because consent, if they don't care about their reputation, there's no consent can bound any behavior.","startTime":"28:56","endTime":"29:03","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So for me, I'm thinking is if we're here,

there's rules that you can apply, there's process as rules.","startTime":"30:46","endTime":"30:51","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you introduced values, and you can codify values, and you can codify them quite well.","startTime":"30:51","endTime":"30:58","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you can say, trust involves this.","startTime":"30:58","endTime":"31:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And trust has.","startTime":"31:01","endTime":"31:02","speaker_name":"David

you.","startTime":"31:18","endTime":"31:19","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can'T, because you broke our trust.","startTime":"31:19","endTime":"31:20","speaker_name":"Jason

down.","startTime":"31:23","endTime":"31:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And more than that, I love the stress test on this man.","startTime":"31:25","endTime":"31:28","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"This is the best because it gets you to put some perspective, guards around your thinking and say, does that work?","startTime":"31:28","endTime":"31:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because that doesn't work for me.","startTime":"31:37","endTime":"31:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's not what the room is about.","startTime":"31:39","endTime":"31:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And certainly that's not who the people in the room are.","startTime":"31:40","endTime":"31:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so a lot of this is.","startTime":"31:43","endTime":"31:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I wouldn't say it's academic, but it's also really relevant to how things work because the stuff will move into realms where we don't have control.","startTime":"31:45","endTime":"31:54","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Immediately working with the chatbot, they're taking it and stealing it.","startTime":"31:55","endTime":"31:58","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So the level of, you know, discourse, you don't want it to be.","startTime":"32:00","endTime":"32:04","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Here's my medical records.","startTime":"32:04","endTime":"32:06","speaker_name":"David

Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, I had an idea that I'm also really.","startTime":"32:14","endTime":"32:16","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"This has been amazing feedback and contribution.","startTime":"32:17","endTime":"32:19","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I had an idea about a workflow on how we would collaboratively write terms

to.","startTime":"32:28","endTime":"32:31","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Go ahead.","startTime":"32:31","endTime":"32:31","speaker_name":"James

interesting.","startTime":"32:40","endTime":"32:45","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"32:46","endTime":"32:46","speaker_name":"James

what?","startTime":"32:51","endTime":"32:51","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm just not going to share my screen.","startTime":"32:51","endTime":"32:52","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm just going to try to describe this really simply.","startTime":"32:52","endTime":"32:55","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So I asked those eight questions.","startTime":"32:58","endTime":"32:59","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I kind of got some ideas about how we might write terms.","startTime":"32:59","endTime":"33:02","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The way that I sort of thought it might work is we just assume that there's terms in place.","startTime":"33:05","endTime":"33:10","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Maybe there are implicit terms that David kind of put in place loosely that I forgot about.","startTime":"33:10","endTime":"33:16","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then.","startTime":"33:18","endTime":"33:18","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then we have a couple sessions and.","startTime":"33:19","endTime":"33:21","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And the first would be like maybe.","startTime":"33:21","endTime":"33:25","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Well, maybe three sessions.","startTime":"33:25","endTime":"33:26","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The goal session, which kind of answers the why are we doing this piece?","startTime":"33:26","endTime":"33:31","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then a term writing session where somebody, anybody on the college volunteers to be a coordinator, and they read a disclosure.","startTime":"33:32","endTime":"33:48","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And people who stay on the call implicitly consent for the purpose, for specific purposes of writing terms.","startTime":"33:49","endTime":"33:55","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Maybe this is better if I show it on screen.","startTime":"33:57","endTime":"33:59","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It gets complicated kind of quickly, but there's only a few steps.","startTime":"33:59","endTime":"34:02","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So anyways, then the chatbot just takes in the previous terms, a prompt for improving terms, and the transcript that everybody just consented to being a part of.","startTime":"34:02","endTime":"34:15","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Then those.","startTime":"34:17","endTime":"34:18","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"The output from the chat bot is circulated.","startTime":"34:18","endTime":"34:21","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And later, like maybe a couple days or a week later, there's like a term adoption session where people have had a chance to read through them, somebody volunteers, and you just go in alphabetical order and you vote for adopting it or not.","startTime":"34:22","endTime":"34:40","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I guess the key concepts here to probably take out of it are like, there's a couple different types of sessions.","startTime":"34:43","endTime":"34:51","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Maybe this kind of factors into Jason's really amazing idea.","startTime":"34:52","endTime":"34:56","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I think about different levels of consent.","startTime":"34:56","endTime":"34:58","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, I consent for the purpose of writing terms.","startTime":"34:58","endTime":"35:00","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I can consent to participating for the purpose of voting on terms of.","startTime":"35:01","endTime":"35:05","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I consent to nothing like this is.","startTime":"35:06","endTime":"35:09","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"This conversation's off the books, are off the record.","startTime":"35:09","endTime":"35:14","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So in one session, we come up with a set of terms, and then in the next session, we try applying it to transcripts.","startTime":"35:15","endTime":"35:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, and I think a bit of the secret sauce here that I Mean, this gets you terms potentially, but maybe it gets you other stuff, like a process on how to leverage the corpus to Hanif's point, where there's a particular prompt that you have in place that doesn't write terms, it just improves terms maybe according to the goal session.","startTime":"35:22","endTime":"35:46","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, it's a pretty complicated workflow, to be honest.","startTime":"35:46","endTime":"35:48","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"There's probably no fewer than two dozen steps to it.","startTime":"35:48","endTime":"35:52","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Cool.","startTime":"35:53","endTime":"35:54","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"That means there's something there.","startTime":"35:54","endTime":"35:55","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But in terms of the process behind the humans, there can be a 1, 2, 3, like 5, 10 minute session in these meetings that we have over the next few sessions.","startTime":"35:56","endTime":"36:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is that something like that?","startTime":"36:05","endTime":"36:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, you could definitely, I think, hold those different sessions in a call.","startTime":"36:06","endTime":"36:12","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"36:13","endTime":"36:13","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Jason, you could hand up, man.","startTime":"36:13","endTime":"36:14","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I was just thinking about Ying's comment about trust and about like, how the society kind of regulates itself.","startTime":"36:15","endTime":"36:24","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Just thinking through, like, what my kind of future experience is.","startTime":"36:24","endTime":"36:29","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like in a place where we have this kind of consent structure, it actually, as I'm sitting here talking about, it's like reducing my trust in everyone here.","startTime":"36:29","endTime":"36:39","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Because that's what I like about the conversation, is that it puts that pressure.","startTime":"36:42","endTime":"36:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"On your thinking because it's because, like, you know, I had a position based off of like the relational web and the intentionality of the participants, and now the structure negates the former structure by which I was evaluating this.","startTime":"36:45","endTime":"37:03","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And thus I need to be very clear about adopting the new structure.","startTime":"37:03","endTime":"37:09","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm not sure about my propensity to do that.","startTime":"37:09","endTime":"37:12","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I like what you said in the way you described the first structure.","startTime":"37:13","endTime":"37:16","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We could actually crystallize that.","startTime":"37:16","endTime":"37:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"37:20","endTime":"37:20","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, like, I totally get it.","startTime":"37:20","endTime":"37:22","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, this came up when somebody

that.","startTime":"39:04","endTime":"39:09","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you actually codify them and there are ways of recourse from

see the mix of values here, and it's something we value.","startTime":"41:05","endTime":"41:09","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Meta value is that there are different values

record.","startTime":"41:50","endTime":"41:52","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And likewise we, you know, black it out and you can't use it because the thing is some things can

most people, but other things, not so much.","startTime":"42:07","endTime":"42:12","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So, for example, I'm actually, and this is total coincidence, writing a piece on chatbots.","startTime":"42:12","endTime":"42:17","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Think you know where this is going.","startTime":"42:19","endTime":"42:20","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And that wonderful conversation we had on, if you ask a chatbot if it's a chat bot, does it have to be truthful or not?","startTime":"42:20","endTime":"42:29","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And the different perspectives on that is like, so rich and

why.","startTime":"42:34","endTime":"42:44","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"42:44","endTime":"42:45","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"That's the big question, too.","startTime":"42:45","endTime":"42:46","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Why, when you know there's a moral

Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"However, if I, you know, even if I don't quote verbatim, if I take high level what that conversation was and post that online, would we all feel comfortable about it?","startTime":"42:58","endTime":"43:10","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Or would we say, someone could guess maybe what group Jen pulled that

things.","startTime":"43:16","endTime":"43:21","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"And now it's publicly online and now, you know, so that's just like a use case where I assumed that what's said here is confidential, like a doctor's office kind of confidential.","startTime":"43:22","endTime":"43:36","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So while it definitely shapes my thinking, I would not presume to quote verbatim that conversation even if I took people's names out.","startTime":"43:36","endTime":"43:46","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"So I'm just putting that out there as like a use case where it's not just like forming how a piece of code works, but like forming how we think and what we say to the world at Large and you know, so that we might want to codify.","startTime":"43:46","endTime":"44:03","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Like is it okay to quote, you know, transcripts or is it okay to anonymize for code and then everyone signs off on that high level.","startTime":"44:03","endTime":"44:14","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"But that's just.","startTime":"44:15","endTime":"44:16","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"44:17","endTime":"44:17","speaker_name":"Jen

in.","startTime":"44:59","endTime":"45:01","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Yeah so in what I see concern here is yeah I, I agree we should have a consent.","startTime":"45:01","endTime":"45:09","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"The reason is to just put a terms out there to remind ourselves and I think what most like what would be valuable is if Jan can provide some unintentionally unintentional behavior.","startTime":"45:09","endTime":"45:26","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"People don't even know they are not supposed to do that in.","startTime":"45:26","endTime":"45:31","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"In this kind of setting of from the literature just so people have better

don't.","startTime":"45:40","endTime":"45:42","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Like for instance, when people don't know what they.","startTime":"45:42","endTime":"45:45","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"What right they have, there's no way they can consent on things.","startTime":"45:45","endTime":"45:50","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"The example would be mental privacy because bci,

can consent and protect that.","startTime":"46:10","endTime":"46:16","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So I'm saying is this group.","startTime":"46:16","endTime":"46:20","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"I would say trust and respect and reputation are at the high priority then.","startTime":"46:21","endTime":"46:28","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Oh you know, intentionally to get something from the intellectual conversation from this group.","startTime":"46:28","endTime":"46:36","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So I think have some have a consent but also have like the examples of what you're not supposed to do

get that part.","startTime":"47:58","endTime":"48:01","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So, yeah, you'd have to see some of that or have to appreciate what that is and
