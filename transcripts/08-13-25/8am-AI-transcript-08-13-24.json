Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Keen on that kind of thing.","startTime":"03:34","endTime":"03:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So what you're talking about is.","startTime":"03:36","endTime":"03:38","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Is what we're playing with.","startTime":"03:38","endTime":"03:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what I want to do is.","startTime":"03:39","endTime":"03:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Not necessarily the actual coding itself, though, have workflows for doing that.","startTime":"03:41","endTime":"03:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it comes out and it's like, yeah, it's kind of what we said, right?","startTime":"03:46","endTime":"03:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's not really doing, man.","startTime":"03:51","endTime":"03:53","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So being the human in the middle, like doing the code is still quite gratifying

Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sub agents doing it.","startTime":"04:00","endTime":"04:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But that's the pattern we're looking at now.","startTime":"04:02","endTime":"04:03","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's like, okay, I'm driving it here.","startTime":"04:03","endTime":"04:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I can have subagents.","startTime":"04:05","endTime":"04:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I can get them doing that.","startTime":"04:06","endTime":"04:07","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And now with this pattern in place, I can just prompt saying, use the planner and then use these other guys to collaborate.","startTime":"04:07","endTime":"04:15","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it'll figure it out.","startTime":"04:15","endTime":"04:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like the Claude will figure it out.","startTime":"04:17","endTime":"04:19","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It'll do the orchestration piece now.","startTime":"04:19","endTime":"04:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or you can give it a workflow.","startTime":"04:23","endTime":"04:24","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it'll actually follow that too.","startTime":"04:24","endTime":"04:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So it's really quite cool with what you're talking about.","startTime":"04:26","endTime":"04:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'd like to see how you're.","startTime":"04:29","endTime":"04:31","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Doing it because it's pretty scatter, like shotgun blasting right now.","startTime":"04:31","endTime":"04:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Trying to figure this out.","startTime":"04:36","endTime":"04:37","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, I'm sort of curious what kind of feedback it's going to give on code reviews, because my understanding is that it can actually you ask it to do a code review on your branch and.","startTime":"04:38","endTime":"04:46","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, I haven't seen it yet, but I'm curious.","startTime":"04:47","endTime":"04:49","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I had to go through a whole directory of repos.","startTime":"04:50","endTime":"04:53","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Turns out it was like 180, 120.","startTime":"04:53","endTime":"04:56","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Different files or apps and got it to write a readme a technical spec, and then figured out how to use playwright.","startTime":"04:57","endTime":"05:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so it went in and loaded the apps and then took a screenshot of it.","startTime":"05:06","endTime":"05:09","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I got it to build a index web page for me.","startTime":"05:10","endTime":"05:13","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that's me figuring out how to have those agents do those works.","startTime":"05:14","endTime":"05:19","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"05:19","endTime":"05:19","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And I'm using CLAUDE inside Cursor to.","startTime":"05:19","endTime":"05:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do that right now is the easiest way.","startTime":"05:23","endTime":"05:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Cloud code inside Cursor, you do that.","startTime":"05:26","endTime":"05:30","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Through the command prompt because I know the agent, there's the agent tab and then you can specify specific model.","startTime":"05:30","endTime":"05:37","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But when I put Claude inside Cursor, it wants to have its own client interface through there.","startTime":"05:37","endTime":"05:44","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, it does its own thing and it is its own thing inside.","startTime":"05:44","endTime":"05:48","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it doesn't integrate the cursor.","startTime":"05:48","endTime":"05:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Agent's pretty good.","startTime":"05:50","endTime":"05:51","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"If you run stuff, if you just run a prompt in there and just rely on the tools and say I have these tools.","startTime":"05:53","endTime":"05:58","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You'll use the tools.","startTime":"05:58","endTime":"06:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, like you say it likes to get a little bit run away sometimes and I have to scale it back.","startTime":"06:01","endTime":"06:05","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But yeah, I'll let you know how it goes with the GitHub stuff.","startTime":"06:05","endTime":"06:08","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, that's where we have the project called Worksona.","startTime":"06:09","endTime":"06:13","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I was thinking about this thing and we're trying to deal with memory and I'm like just markdown files.","startTime":"06:13","endTime":"06:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like I'm looking at projects and you're just using markdown files and just, you know, there's just these simple patterns being put in place.","startTime":"06:18","endTime":"06:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They're useful.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:24","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so I was looking at GitHub and seeing if I could just use it for the memory component because of just using git and check ins and then reconciling.","startTime":"06:25","endTime":"06:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What you could do is you do PRs to reconcile and have long term memory.","startTime":"06:36","endTime":"06:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like it worked out like you know, short term midterm, long term memory.","startTime":"06:39","endTime":"06:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then I'm like, well, what if you put the agent in there?","startTime":"06:44","endTime":"06:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I guess it does have enough context to run itself.","startTime":"06:47","endTime":"06:53","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, they can deploy like if you give it, because it has actions, you.","startTime":"06:54","endTime":"06:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can deploy it to any environment and.","startTime":"06:57","endTime":"07:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Then if you give it a manifest, it can figure out what environment it.","startTime":"07:00","endTime":"07:03","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Wants to go into and then it'll figure out the code to do that.","startTime":"07:03","endTime":"07:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So that was like too much.","startTime":"07:06","endTime":"07:08","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But that pattern is really useful.","startTime":"07:10","endTime":"07:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"In fact, the agents that I've built, you do an install process in your project and this is an experiment to see how this goes.","startTime":"07:12","endTime":"07:19","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you do an install in your project, you invite the agents in, you can customize them or you can build.","startTime":"07:19","endTime":"07:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Specific to the project too.","startTime":"07:25","endTime":"07:26","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And they work inside the project and then they have their memory inside the project.","startTime":"07:27","endTime":"07:32","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every time they do a report it.","startTime":"07:32","endTime":"07:34","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Goes into memory and they have, it's.","startTime":"07:34","endTime":"07:35","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Just a markdown file.","startTime":"07:35","endTime":"07:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they have a shared memory through.","startTime":"07:36","endTime":"07:38","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Markdown and they have a workflow through markdown.","startTime":"07:38","endTime":"07:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so it's really simple stuff, but it adds this level of visibility as.","startTime":"07:40","endTime":"07:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To what's going on.","startTime":"07:45","endTime":"07:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And also, if you just.","startTime":"07:46","endTime":"07:48","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"If you just prompt, it, just does it.","startTime":"07:49","endTime":"07:51","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So if you.","startTime":"07:52","endTime":"07:53","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you're like, I need this, I'm like, oh, I'll use the Doc writer agent for that.","startTime":"07:53","endTime":"07:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm like, well, you wouldn't talk like that unless I put that in there.","startTime":"07:57","endTime":"08:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So it relies on the fact that it now has.","startTime":"08:03","endTime":"08:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Claude does it?","startTime":"08:06","endTime":"08:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Realizing the fact that it has 60 different agents that are specialized, it'll use them instead of just going off and doing stuff.","startTime":"08:06","endTime":"08:11","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's very cool.","startTime":"08:13","endTime":"08:14","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We're.","startTime":"08:14","endTime":"08:14","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"We're getting further down the rabbit hole as we go, as we progress.","startTime":"08:15","endTime":"08:19","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"08:19","endTime":"08:20","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, and so this is kind of full circle.","startTime":"08:21","endTime":"08:24","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I. I was wanting to get the repos or the.","startTime":"08:24","endTime":"08:27","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The transcripts from last week, and from the last.","startTime":"08:27","endTime":"08:30","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Turns out, it was 50 weeks.","startTime":"08:30","endTime":"08:31","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I think there's a couple more that I just had different names for.","startTime":"08:32","endTime":"08:35","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But I've installed the MCP into Cloud Desktop and it doesn't want to do.","startTime":"08:35","endTime":"08:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"All 50 files, of course, but it.","startTime":"08:43","endTime":"08:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Did eventually build me a table of contexts, like a table of all of them, and gave me a summary of all of them and gave me highlights for them.","startTime":"08:46","endTime":"08:56","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So it did do some of the.","startTime":"08:56","endTime":"08:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It looked at the summaries for them.","startTime":"08:57","endTime":"08:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then did that down.","startTime":"08:59","endTime":"09:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I've been trying to install it into cursor.","startTime":"09:01","endTime":"09:04","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The MCP into cursor, because I did a session.","startTime":"09:05","endTime":"09:08","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm like, can I actually download the transcripts if I put the MCP inside cursor?","startTime":"09:08","endTime":"09:15","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I asked Claude that with the MCP.","startTime":"09:16","endTime":"09:18","speaker_name":"David

yes.","startTime":"09:22","endTime":"09:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's a really good use of it.","startTime":"09:23","endTime":"09:24","speaker_name":"David

just prompt this man and not even have any ui.","startTime":"09:30","endTime":"09:34","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I've got an open directory and I'm like, I'm trying to get the cursor thing working.","startTime":"09:34","endTime":"09:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm like, I don't need anything in this

it.","startTime":"09:41","endTime":"09:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Meaning you can only do so many per

Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Beginning saying, here's some things to get started, and then of course, there'll be more interest in it.","startTime":"14:56","endTime":"15:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then, you know, because we're humans, we can shuffle things around.","startTime":"15:03","endTime":"15:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"15:06","endTime":"15:07","speaker_name":"James

Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Back to your original point was like, how do you.","startTime":"15:15","endTime":"15:19","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, where do you store this stuff in a secure place?","startTime":"15:22","endTime":"15:24","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And what I was.","startTime":"15:25","endTime":"15:26","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The two topics that I was starting to think about were like, okay, so change management is a topic.","startTime":"15:27","endTime":"15:32","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's something that I've kind of dealt with at work.","startTime":"15:32","endTime":"15:34","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, that can go well or go badly when you introduce a new tool, it's like, oh, how does this work?","startTime":"15:34","endTime":"15:41","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And, you know, and then change control is kind of close to version control, which is GitHub.","startTime":"15:41","endTime":"15:51","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I feel like GitHub is actually a fairly.","startTime":"15:51","endTime":"15:54","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I just think it's so brilliant how you can collaborate on that platform because the whole way that change and versions are controlled is like software based.","startTime":"15:55","endTime":"16:10","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you can sum.","startTime":"16:11","endTime":"16:13","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So then I was looking at like, okay, so if you were to get the transcripts onto GitHub, how do you do that?","startTime":"16:13","endTime":"16:19","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like what's the process?","startTime":"16:19","endTime":"16:19","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, do you get consent?","startTime":"16:20","endTime":"16:22","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Do you set up like web hooks to sort of like grab it from a Google Drive and upload it?","startTime":"16:22","endTime":"16:30","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like how do you.","startTime":"16:31","endTime":"16:32","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, so it's not as simple maybe as like unless you want to sign up for like a pre service.","startTime":"16:32","endTime":"16:41","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like what's that service that you pick?","startTime":"16:42","endTime":"16:44","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So what's interesting is you've kind of nailed a core set of things that.","startTime":"16:45","endTime":"16:52","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We already have and can use and they can stitch together and then move out.","startTime":"16:52","endTime":"16:58","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Meaning GitHub is free and the MCP enables like a small app to.","startTime":"16:59","endTime":"17:07","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Every week just move the transcripts into the repo.","startTime":"17:07","endTime":"17:10","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then permissions are based on participation.","startTime":"17:11","endTime":"17:14","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"17:15","endTime":"17:15","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like you can make it a private repo, you can make it read only.","startTime":"17:15","endTime":"17:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You can do those things.","startTime":"17:18","endTime":"17:19","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then people can branch and they can do things.","startTime":"17:19","endTime":"17:22","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And there's ways to have GitHub actions.","startTime":"17:22","endTime":"17:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"To act on it, meaning we can have agents.","startTime":"17:25","endTime":"17:27","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Now GitHub has large language models accessible.","startTime":"17:27","endTime":"17:30","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Within it, so it recognize what it can do too.","startTime":"17:30","endTime":"17:33","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"17:33","endTime":"17:33","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So there's the ability to use it.","startTime":"17:36","endTime":"17:38","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"As a substrate for a whole lot of things.","startTime":"17:38","endTime":"17:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"In this case files.","startTime":"17:40","endTime":"17:42","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's a great place.","startTime":"17:44","endTime":"17:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I immediately create a folder and create a GitHub repo now.","startTime":"17:46","endTime":"17:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so this makes a lot of.","startTime":"17:50","endTime":"17:52","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Sense to just say, well, we can clone it, we can all have a copy and then you can.","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"17:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Do pull requests and stuff like that.","startTime":"17:59","endTime":"18:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the neat thing about it is it can be a primary set.","startTime":"18:02","endTime":"18:04","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Of information and then it can produce these secondary things and move on and.","startTime":"18:04","endTime":"18:08","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"On in a closed or open loop there.","startTime":"18:08","endTime":"18:11","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So cool thinking, man.","startTime":"18:13","endTime":"18:14","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It aligns with what we started with last week and then what we've talked.","startTime":"18:14","endTime":"18:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"About today and even when Miles was bringing in.","startTime":"18:18","endTime":"18:20","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, yeah, definitely.","startTime":"18:21","endTime":"18:23","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So this is, I think that's a like out of the gate, that's something.","startTime":"18:23","endTime":"18:26","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That I can do.","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:27","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"If this thing works in the background, that's something I can try right away because I could just say create a.","startTime":"18:29","endTime":"18:33","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Repo and then put like it's no effort to do that.","startTime":"18:33","endTime":"18:37","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I was going to have to share somehow.","startTime":"18:38","endTime":"18:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And it was going to be a.","startTime":"18:40","endTime":"18:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Question I root putting things in Google Drive.","startTime":"18:41","endTime":"18:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you know, the agent's not getting, it's getting better.","startTime":"18:47","endTime":"18:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that has value too.","startTime":"18:51","endTime":"18:52","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But where are you currently storing the summary of the transcripts from PowerPoint?","startTime":"18:53","endTime":"18:58","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So right now I do ad hoc, I download them.","startTime":"18:59","endTime":"19:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I started seeing a lot of value in processing like a year or longer ago.","startTime":"19:03","endTime":"19:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But they have their own agents too that you can trigger and do special

their system, meaning.","startTime":"19:34","endTime":"19:37","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There is an API to export it into another more open system like a GitHub, that's just a technical thing.","startTime":"19:37","endTime":"19:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And we could do it a number of ways.","startTime":"19:45","endTime":"19:47","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It turns out it's really easy to do with the new tools like an mcp.","startTime":"19:47","endTime":"19:51","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So.","startTime":"19:51","endTime":"19:52","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And that MCP has a lot of value.","startTime":"19:52","endTime":"19:53","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And, and then it means also that

transcript.","startTime":"20:13","endTime":"20:14","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But if they're not in the meeting, we need to do that thing, pull it out, make a document,

me.","startTime":"20:40","endTime":"20:42","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So it sounds like we kind of agree, like this would be a cool way to do

take.","startTime":"20:56","endTime":"20:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right now is the sort of the.","startTime":"20:57","endTime":"20:59","speaker_name":"David

share it.","startTime":"21:00","endTime":"21:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So I would figure out how to.","startTime":"21:02","endTime":"21:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Take the file, the transcript and the audio just because we would like that.","startTime":"21:06","endTime":"21:10","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then put them in a directory inside a repo.","startTime":"21:11","endTime":"21:15","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then the neat thing about GitHub is that we can share ownership and.","startTime":"21:16","endTime":"21:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Then people can invite people.","startTime":"21:21","endTime":"21:22","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so it can be easy to invite this room and people can get an account for free.","startTime":"21:22","endTime":"21:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And if we make it private, that again, can be a sponsorship thing from somebody that has the

Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We could also then discuss that.","startTime":"21:38","endTime":"21:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It has a wiki and it has all these other things too, that if things become useful.","startTime":"21:40","endTime":"21:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But really what it does have is.","startTime":"21:44","endTime":"21:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The ability to throw agents at it and make secondary research happen as a platform.","startTime":"21:46","endTime":"21:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"All right, sure.","startTime":"21:50","endTime":"21:52","speaker_name":"James

you.","startTime":"21:55","endTime":"21:56","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It seems so simple what we actually do on a daily basis when we're putting together a meeting.","startTime":"21:57","endTime":"22:01","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But like.","startTime":"22:01","endTime":"22:02","speaker_name":"James

without.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:04","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Sorry.","startTime":"22:04","endTime":"22:05","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Without getting to the weeds.","startTime":"22:05","endTime":"22:06","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So how it would work from scratch.","startTime":"22:07","endTime":"22:09","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"22:09","endTime":"22:10","speaker_name":"James

then.","startTime":"22:12","endTime":"22:14","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How you integrate it, you get invited to this meeting somehow.","startTime":"22:14","endTime":"22:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, let's start with you.","startTime":"22:18","endTime":"22:19","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Let's start with you.","startTime":"22:19","endTime":"22:20","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like you don't have any accounts anywhere, so you go and you sign up for GitHub first, right?","startTime":"22:20","endTime":"22:27","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"22:27","endTime":"22:28","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I would need a GitHub account.","startTime":"22:28","endTime":"22:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where I want to store information.","startTime":"22:29","endTime":"22:30","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"22:31","endTime":"22:31","speaker_name":"James

Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"What.","startTime":"22:32","endTime":"22:32","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then do you need a Google account to sign up?","startTime":"22:34","endTime":"22:37","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I guess you need a Google account for.","startTime":"22:37","endTime":"22:38","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"For that.","startTime":"22:38","endTime":"22:39","speaker_name":"James

Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Probably.","startTime":"22:39","endTime":"22:40","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You need email and phone pretty much nowadays.","startTime":"22:40","endTime":"22:44","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And if you don't have one, I would get a Google.","startTime":"22:45","endTime":"22:48","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then you sign up for.","startTime":"22:48","endTime":"22:49","speaker_name":"James

I.","startTime":"22:52","endTime":"22:53","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We've just been with Fireflies because at the time over two years ago, it made sense and it has an API.","startTime":"22:53","endTime":"22:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so there's.","startTime":"22:59","endTime":"22:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"What you need to do is integrate.","startTime":"23:00","endTime":"23:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"With.","startTime":"23:02","endTime":"23:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Whoever your meeting software is will.","startTime":"23:04","endTime":"23:07","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Somehow have transcripts and you need to get those transcripts into GitHub.","startTime":"23:07","endTime":"23:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Okay.","startTime":"23:12","endTime":"23:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Do you think Fireflies is the best?","startTime":"23:13","endTime":"23:14","speaker_name":"James

so.","startTime":"23:15","endTime":"23:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the API is helpful.","startTime":"23:17","endTime":"23:19","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"23:20","endTime":"23:20","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"23:21","endTime":"23:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But I just had to upgrade to.","startTime":"23:21","endTime":"23:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Get the access to the API.","startTime":"23:23","endTime":"23:24","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So, you know, nothing free.","startTime":"23:24","endTime":"23:27","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"23:28","endTime":"23:28","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I was looking at Otter and I mean the.","startTime":"23:31","endTime":"23:35","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"The summaries that Fathom produced were like, in my opinion, far superior to Fireflies.","startTime":"23:35","endTime":"23:41","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"23:41","endTime":"23:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so they should all have an API that allows you to get access to your.","startTime":"23:41","endTime":"23:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that would be something I would just use One of these LLMs to do is like do a comparison.","startTime":"23:46","endTime":"23:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Say, do a comparison.","startTime":"23:50","endTime":"23:53","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Which one gives you what you want.","startTime":"23:53","endTime":"23:55","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Are you concerned about security, where it resides, all the other things, Is it price point?","startTime":"23:55","endTime":"23:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is it API?","startTime":"23:59","endTime":"24:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And in this case, API is most important because I've used their system and it's terrible.","startTime":"24:01","endTime":"24:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You're locked into these workflows that are awkward and we want just the RAW file.","startTime":"24:07","endTime":"24:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So that would be my thing is they are modern too.","startTime":"24:12","endTime":"24:16","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I did a search and since I use AI cursor coding, an MCP makes a lot of this stuff happen without.","startTime":"24:16","endTime":"24:26","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Having to do any coding.","startTime":"24:26","endTime":"24:27","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"There's either the ability to write some code to download all the files to.","startTime":"24:28","endTime":"24:35","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Build that you can manually do it, or you can use an MCP that then you can just prompt your way through it.","startTime":"24:35","endTime":"24:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then you would either download them to your desktop and then sync them, or you would figure out a pipeline that will do it automatically.","startTime":"24:41","endTime":"24:53","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So that.","startTime":"24:54","endTime":"24:55","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, I was trying to figure out the pipeline.","startTime":"24:55","endTime":"24:57","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So the pipeline, but I think it costs money.","startTime":"24:58","endTime":"25:01","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So no, right now the pipeline, I get a Google document that automatically gets.","startTime":"25:02","endTime":"25:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Generated from Fireflies.","startTime":"25:05","endTime":"25:07","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I need to figure out the GitHub trigger for that.","startTime":"25:08","endTime":"25:10","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Would you maybe use like Zapier to do that?","startTime":"25:12","endTime":"25:15","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So that's how I would suggest somebody that doesn't have like, doesn't have the coding proficiency.","startTime":"25:16","endTime":"25:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's re.","startTime":"25:23","endTime":"25:24","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's exactly what those tools are for, gluing these things together.","startTime":"25:24","endTime":"25:27","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you figured it out.","startTime":"25:28","endTime":"25:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So you've got something in Fireflies.","startTime":"25:29","endTime":"25:32","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Does Zapier have a connector between that and GitHub?","startTime":"25:32","endTime":"25:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Like, everything should connect to GitHub.","startTime":"25:36","endTime":"25:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Well, even say, like, say you want the upload to happen like on the cloud.","startTime":"25:39","endTime":"25:46","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like, say I have a computer that I just don't want to save anything onto.","startTime":"25:46","endTime":"25:50","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's a smart thing.","startTime":"25:51","endTime":"25:52","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"25:52","endTime":"25:53","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Would you still use Zapier if you like to run that process?","startTime":"25:54","endTime":"25:58","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Like where would you run that API, call and upload.","startTime":"25:58","endTime":"26:02","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So things need triggers and that's.","startTime":"26:02","endTime":"26:04","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Where the integrations come in.","startTime":"26:04","endTime":"26:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So Zapier can integrate with your meetings.","startTime":"26:06","endTime":"26:08","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then it would know when you've had one and saying that it could integrate with.","startTime":"26:08","endTime":"26:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I don't know to what degree fireflies.","startTime":"26:15","endTime":"26:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"API allows for triggering other

Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It seems to be arrestful.","startTime":"26:27","endTime":"26:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So you have to determine that and if it's something you schedule it.","startTime":"26:29","endTime":"26:34","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Or either that or it happens automatically.","startTime":"26:34","endTime":"26:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And these are programmatic things and they're.","startTime":"26:36","endTime":"26:38","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Limited by how much you pay, but.","startTime":"26:38","endTime":"26:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You can certainly with Zapier or something like that, you can time things.","startTime":"26:41","endTime":"26:44","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like you can certainly, I'm.","startTime":"26:44","endTime":"26:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Sure you can connect it to Your calendar, so that every time you have.","startTime":"26:46","endTime":"26:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"A meeting, right after your meeting, you go look for a new file, you know, like that's the kind of thing it's supposed to do.","startTime":"26:50","endTime":"26:56","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So say we wanted to have Miles conduct the meeting.","startTime":"26:58","endTime":"27:01","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Then he's got his own.","startTime":"27:01","endTime":"27:05","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Say we're going with Fathom and Zapier, unless there's something cheaper and better.","startTime":"27:05","endTime":"27:13","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But just for example, obviously.","startTime":"27:15","endTime":"27:16","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So say Miles.","startTime":"27:17","endTime":"27:18","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Say you're on vacation and Miles wants to conduct a meeting and upload the Transcript to the GitHub that week.","startTime":"27:18","endTime":"27:27","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Does that work?","startTime":"27:28","endTime":"27:29","speaker_name":"James

there?","startTime":"27:29","endTime":"27:36","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"That's one way it could work.","startTime":"27:36","endTime":"27:38","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's.","startTime":"27:38","endTime":"27:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's easier if it's, say like one.","startTime":"27:39","endTime":"27:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Person sets up the meeting, it's owned by that calendar event and that person.","startTime":"27:40","endTime":"27:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Owns the calendar event.","startTime":"27:45","endTime":"27:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then you have moderators inside that.","startTime":"27:46","endTime":"27:48","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And the reason for that is then.","startTime":"27:49","endTime":"27:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You just have one account connected to that one Zapier kind of thing connected to Fireflies.","startTime":"27:50","endTime":"27:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Instead of needing to have federated identities working in an OAuth

Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But that's where I'm at with that.","startTime":"37:44","endTime":"37:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that, what it'll do is this is me manually downloading them into the directory and then the directory has an associate.","startTime":"37:47","endTime":"37:53","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It is the repo and it will manage that.","startTime":"37:53","endTime":"37:56","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Or wait, so there is a repo on GitHub.","startTime":"37:57","endTime":"38:01","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's the same repo.","startTime":"38:01","endTime":"38:03","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm remote and it is Origin.","startTime":"38:03","endTime":"38:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"38:07","endTime":"38:07","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I'm going to push to Origin.","startTime":"38:07","endTime":"38:09","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then because I own it and all that, there's going to be a few less steps than normally.","startTime":"38:09","endTime":"38:13","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But that's how that would work.","startTime":"38:13","endTime":"38:15","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But most likely I would do that for maybe a week or two.","startTime":"38:15","endTime":"38:19","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just this is how programmers go.","startTime":"38:21","endTime":"38:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I would do that for a week or two because then I would either get lazy or forget and then I would step back and say, okay, the.","startTime":"38:23","endTime":"38:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Steps are straightforward, I can take myself out of them.","startTime":"38:29","endTime":"38:33","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then it would put them on a server that would either do the.","startTime":"38:34","endTime":"38:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Cron jobs, get triggers, be pulled like it would be an endpoint and then could be triggered.","startTime":"38:36","endTime":"38:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"We would figure out what that is, but it would.","startTime":"38:43","endTime":"38:44","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Instead of be, instead of coming to me on my machine as an intermediary step and managing that, it would just go make a call and then it.","startTime":"38:44","endTime":"38:54","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Would do something and then go bang right into GitHub or get routed.","startTime":"38:54","endTime":"38:58","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You sit on a server somewhere?","startTime":"38:58","endTime":"39:00","speaker_name":"James

depending on how much server it requires.","startTime":"39:02","endTime":"39:08","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's most likely just a call, like an endpoint, and then the endpoint helps make that happen.","startTime":"39:08","endTime":"39:15","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So there's, and I'm, you know, I'm talking on my hat because these are conditional things and there's lots of ways of doing them now.","startTime":"39:16","endTime":"39:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so that's the neat thing is.","startTime":"39:23","endTime":"39:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like what you tried to do with Fathom and Zapier as the.","startTime":"39:25","endTime":"39:31","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Technology set provided a path there, you just have to make different assumptions.","startTime":"39:31","endTime":"39:37","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if you make the same assumptions all the way along, like conventions like call things the same thing in.","startTime":"39:37","endTime":"39:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Your calendar and then, then that gets tracked into your transcript naming and then that gets, you know, then eventually makes it into your GitHub repo is the same sort of thing.","startTime":"39:43","endTime":"39:55","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So it gets organized according to a really essential tag.","startTime":"39:55","endTime":"40:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And since we meet at a, you know, the.","startTime":"40:00","endTime":"40:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's the.","startTime":"40:06","endTime":"40:07","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a time and a date and then, you know, if we got really organized, then we would have all the metadata around the system that says who attended and all the other things.","startTime":"40:07","endTime":"40:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But Miles, what are you thinking?","startTime":"40:17","endTime":"40:19","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Is this.","startTime":"40:19","endTime":"40:20","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, I'm curious, is this just an experiment?","startTime":"40:20","endTime":"40:22","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Like, I, I totally understand what you're trying to do.","startTime":"40:22","endTime":"40:25","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Was it just an experiment to get an MCP to basically parse out the transcripts and then get it into a shot shared space?","startTime":"40:26","endTime":"40:33","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Or are you working on some sort of business case?","startTime":"40:34","endTime":"40:36","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Just curious about the motivation.","startTime":"40:37","endTime":"40:39","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So there's a piece of string there, right.","startTime":"40:41","endTime":"40:44","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So this peer group, the way that.","startTime":"40:44","endTime":"40:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It works, the way that meetings work, the things left on the table once.","startTime":"40:45","endTime":"40:49","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"They'Re in the repo, you can have multiple agents going at it.","startTime":"40:49","endTime":"40:51","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Call them the Curiosity Council.","startTime":"40:51","endTime":"40:53","speaker_name":"David

great.","startTime":"41:00","endTime":"41:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Coming at it from different points of view and then saying, this meeting does this.","startTime":"41:02","endTime":"41:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What about all the meetings?","startTime":"41:05","endTime":"41:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh, guess what?","startTime":"41:06","endTime":"41:07","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"There's a thread going through it.","startTime":"41:07","endTime":"41:08","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's the power that I see in these agents is like we do something really primary, like have these conversations and then have these agents try to stitch the pattern recognition together for you or eke out questions that are really good and that can happen at a secondary level.","startTime":"41:08","endTime":"41:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's kind of this pattern that.","startTime":"41:23","endTime":"41:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm currently working to try to see if we can support ourselves better, do the work.","startTime":"41:25","endTime":"41:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's kind of like quality control, right?","startTime":"41:29","endTime":"41:31","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's actually like knowledge mining or something.","startTime":"41:31","endTime":"41:34","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it's a, it's a tertiary piece to your core effort.","startTime":"41:35","endTime":"41:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, this is the most intelligent engagement.","startTime":"41:41","endTime":"41:44","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We will have is in these rooms.","startTime":"41:44","endTime":"41:47","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"We're only capturing the words right now.","startTime":"41:48","endTime":"41:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But after this, it's just information.","startTime":"41:50","endTime":"41:55","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, I kind of see it.","startTime":"41:57","endTime":"41:58","speaker_name":"James

I.","startTime":"42:00","endTime":"42:00","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So, yeah, I kind of just see it as like a resource as well for curiosity of everybody.","startTime":"42:01","endTime":"42:07","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if you can find a really good, preferably free way to make the conversations accessible for knowledge mining, just like you said, then that's like a really powerful thing.","startTime":"42:07","endTime":"42:22","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's a really powerful foundation for work later to like look back on that stuff and synthesize it or mine it for ideas or workflows.","startTime":"42:22","endTime":"42:34","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's like, what did he say about this?","startTime":"42:34","endTime":"42:36","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"How does that work?","startTime":"42:36","endTime":"42:37","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"It's like this whole thread to continue to pull on.","startTime":"42:38","endTime":"42:41","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Yeah, I do see the value there as well.","startTime":"42:42","endTime":"42:44","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What's.","startTime":"42:44","endTime":"42:44","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What I'm thinking about would be interesting is because you could have a secondary pass on all over the, over all the topics and have the agents sort of spawn off and do some curiosity exploration there.","startTime":"42:45","endTime":"42:57","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But how do you come back and then now summarize the results of that and then like, what's the feedback loop?","startTime":"42:58","endTime":"43:05","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know what I mean?","startTime":"43:05","endTime":"43:05","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So for next meeting, maybe we talk about these other, this other layer that's come back and said, yeah, we realize that there's, you know, you had 10 things and now we have a thousand.","startTime":"43:05","endTime":"43:16","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"What does that look like in terms of structure?","startTime":"43:19","endTime":"43:21","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"You know, I mean, for me the.","startTime":"43:22","endTime":"43:26","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Takeaway is like, once you have that substrate, as David put it, and you start Mining it for curiosity and that stuff.","startTime":"43:26","endTime":"43:34","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I feel like what you're accruing there is just the whole understanding about how to mine this activity and it kind of goes towards understanding things like change management.","startTime":"43:35","endTime":"43:47","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So if I'm just doing my job and I do a bad, kind of a bad job of like implementing a new tool and I go like, oh, like I didn't even know change management exists, you know, before.","startTime":"43:48","endTime":"44:01","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'm just like operating at layer level one.","startTime":"44:01","endTime":"44:05","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I'll call it level one.","startTime":"44:05","endTime":"44:06","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Not to get confused with blockchain here.","startTime":"44:06","endTime":"44:08","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Level one, not layer one.","startTime":"44:08","endTime":"44:10","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You know, once you have that foundation of the accessible transcripts for every to mine.","startTime":"44:11","endTime":"44:16","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Now you're working at level two.","startTime":"44:16","endTime":"44:18","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You're like, okay, well now I know how to, you know, kind of sick these agents on this transcript and get, get, you know, find some curiosity.","startTime":"44:19","endTime":"44:30","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And then maybe there's other levels too, like, I don't know.","startTime":"44:30","endTime":"44:33","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But that's where I want to be.","startTime":"44:33","endTime":"44:34","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I want to be at level two.","startTime":"44:34","endTime":"44:36","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, it could be like, it could be infinite really, depending on the topic we're talking about.","startTime":"44:36","endTime":"44:42","speaker_name":"Myles Holt","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"44:42","endTime":"44:42","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because at some point it's going to get into a philosophical

Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Exactly.","startTime":"44:54","endTime":"44:55","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The way that you're kind of laddering it up is that I have all these repos move quickly.","startTime":"44:55","endTime":"44:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They certainly serve a purpose.","startTime":"44:59","endTime":"45:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I've learn something and I can

Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I had these things document themselves as you normally would, then point some agents to understand it in the context of business or whatever, then get them to

was.","startTime":"46:19","endTime":"46:20","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Was I wanted the text back in the readme and I figured I could summarize those somehow.","startTime":"46:20","endTime":"46:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And then what it did allow to do is say here was the direction.","startTime":"46:25","endTime":"46:28","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Now where can we take it given.","startTime":"46:29","endTime":"46:30","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We'Re talking to these five

they're just stupid simple things.","startTime":"46:48","endTime":"46:54","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so what you can do once you have that corpus is you can then was this here.","startTime":"46:54","endTime":"46:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can you find me traces of this?","startTime":"47:00","endTime":"47:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Can you do this?","startTime":"47:03","endTime":"47:04","speaker_name":"David

enough.","startTime":"47:06","endTime":"47:07","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But that's, that's something I think.","startTime":"47:07","endTime":"47:09","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You pointed to and I think what does it look like?","startTime":"47:09","endTime":"47:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, it's all human readable at this point.","startTime":"47:12","endTime":"47:14","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"For me the readmes are good.","startTime":"47:14","endTime":"47:16","speaker_name":"David

and.","startTime":"47:57","endTime":"47:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We do the same sort of thing with the project and we use this meeting room as this is the core sort of backbone to how we manage the project and we discuss things here in the project, we can, this is the first use is we cue things up well and say things that are keywords, then we can get prompts based on them and we can be self referential in our meetings and get the prompts to be acting on what we're doing.","startTime":"47:59","endTime":"48:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"This is a step back from that saying do the work in your project.","startTime":"48:21","endTime":"48:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And have everything about project management happen.","startTime":"48:25","endTime":"48:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"On as
