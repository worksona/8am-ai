want.","startTime":"09:12","endTime":"09:14","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And basically you compose the stone and then you can to send off the

you can do it manually.","startTime":"09:30","endTime":"09:39","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And we see this as the opportunity is to create a conversational AI agent

network.","startTime":"10:01","endTime":"10:06","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"One is through the sharing of a stone, so that connects people.","startTime":"10:06","endTime":"10:10","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"That's a more serendipitous network.","startTime":"10:11","endTime":"10:13","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"We call it an affinity

a term created by one of the researchers.","startTime":"11:15","endTime":"11:24","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And it relates to, you know, how, to how innovation moves in and out of siloed networks.","startTime":"11:24","endTime":"11:32","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And so we felt this was one kind of good way for us to look at network formation.","startTime":"11:33","endTime":"11:41","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So that's a key piece for us and we've applied to create a BC for funding for pilots.","startTime":"11:41","endTime":"11:50","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And what we see with that is 144 stones distributed in Vancouver or

communities.","startTime":"11:57","endTime":"12:00","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And that's our learning

pick through any kind of map that we have a bunch of styles for and searchable.","startTime":"14:01","endTime":"14:10","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And basically you can compose the stone that you want and then you save it.","startTime":"14:12","endTime":"14:19","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And then there's a workflow that creates a print file that we then print on some PVA film and then that goes through the whole hydrographic process.","startTime":"14:20","endTime":"14:30","speaker_name":"Hanif

you produce a certain.","startTime":"14:34","endTime":"14:38","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Kind of file format.","startTime":"14:38","endTime":"14:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Or is it just a print file?","startTime":"14:39","endTime":"14:41","speaker_name":"David

really cool.","startTime":"14:59","endTime":"15:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And that adds that texture to it.","startTime":"15:01","endTime":"15:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"15:03","endTime":"15:03","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And when we did our first round of this, we found a lot of people were interested in the map styles themselves and there's a whole community of map makers and

have been talking about, there's been some interesting ways.","startTime":"15:25","endTime":"15:30","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Of phrasing it so that it's approachable for us.","startTime":"15:30","endTime":"15:33","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's Cat Rocks 2.0, 10.0.","startTime":"15:33","endTime":"15:36","speaker_name":"David

Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I think it's a very cool project.","startTime":"15:53","endTime":"15:54","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"I'm curious about the substrate.","startTime":"15:56","endTime":"15:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Does the type of rock matter when you're doing the etching onto it?","startTime":"15:57","endTime":"16:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, it kind of does, but not.","startTime":"16:02","endTime":"16:04","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Not terribly.","startTime":"16:04","endTime":"16:06","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"What we found is that there's certain kinds of rocks that are, you know, smoother and they need to be.","startTime":"16:07","endTime":"16:13","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"They need to have a certain shape because the process is you're basically dipping them through film in water and so you don't want air to get trapped.","startTime":"16:14","endTime":"16:26","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So they have to have a kind of curved shape.","startTime":"16:27","endTime":"16:29","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But other than that.","startTime":"16:29","endTime":"16:30","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And is there a dimension?","startTime":"16:31","endTime":"16:33","speaker_name":"David

Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah, but if I wanted to have something on the front of like say in my lawn or something, somebody walking around.","startTime":"16:36","endTime":"16:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yes, super cool.","startTime":"16:42","endTime":"16:44","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So actually that was part of our research as well.","startTime":"16:44","endTime":"16:47","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"We did some very big stones and yeah, it's.","startTime":"16:47","endTime":"16:51","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Oh, basically the size of the tank that will limit, you know, and stones get heavy.","startTime":"16:52","endTime":"16:57","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But yeah, we looked at that and there's some pretty cool possibilities also with the underlying paint.","startTime":"16:58","endTime":"17:05","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So photosensitive paints, thermal paints, etc, could be an interesting way to augment the certain landscaping.","startTime":"17:06","endTime":"17:16","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"I think it's a super cool project and it reminds me a bit of geocaching.","startTime":"17:19","endTime":"17:24","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"I don't know if you guys.","startTime":"17:24","endTime":"17:25","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Yeah, it reminds me a bit of geocaching and that was like my first thought.","startTime":"17:25","endTime":"17:29","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"And then like, I don't know, maybe this is too like digital for this, this type of project.","startTime":"17:29","endTime":"17:36","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"But it also just had me thinking about like online games and you know, like maybe some sort of Pokemon.","startTime":"17:36","endTime":"17:44","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Yeah, like some sort of thing where the NFT and an online game and like the, you know, could.","startTime":"17:44","endTime":"17:52","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Could have a relationship with this project as well.","startTime":"17:52","endTime":"17:55","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Sure.","startTime":"17:56","endTime":"17:56","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But maybe that's too online for the stones, but.","startTime":"17:56","endTime":"17:59","speaker_name":"Spencer MacBeth","speaker_id":6},{"sentence":"Well, no, I think there's a lot about what.","startTime":"18:00","endTime":"18:02","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Basically what we found is there's so many possibilities.","startTime":"18:02","endTime":"18:05","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Like the whole game side of it and playing game theory is super interesting.","startTime":"18:05","endTime":"18:11","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"There's.","startTime":"18:13","endTime":"18:13","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"I know there was one sequence where we did was like, okay, try to get it somewhere.","startTime":"18:14","endTime":"18:18","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Try to get the stone over, you know, get it Into Fort Knox, that kind of thing, and give it a destination.","startTime":"18:18","endTime":"18:26","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So one scenario we came up with was 100 stones in each of 100 cities trying to get to the other city.","startTime":"18:26","endTime":"18:34","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So this kind of cross pollination and, you know, serendipitous.","startTime":"18:35","endTime":"18:38","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"It might make it might not.","startTime":"18:38","endTime":"18:40","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"18:40","endTime":"18:41","speaker_name":"David

how.","startTime":"18:50","endTime":"18:52","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So there are lots of game possibilities, especially with a simple device that can have many mechanics.","startTime":"18:53","endTime":"18:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It was evolutionary rules along those lines and how to institute a pathway of increasing capabilities that either the network itself does or the stone does.","startTime":"19:00","endTime":"19:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And after doing some work and research and whatever, I returned to Conway's Game of Life again, because it provides like, one of the best sort of analyses on the evolution of complex

it.","startTime":"19:38","endTime":"19:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"They combine.","startTime":"19:39","endTime":"19:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"They combine on top of each other.","startTime":"19:40","endTime":"19:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And you have this notion of network.","startTime":"19:41","endTime":"19:44","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And the idea of network is so fabulously wild.","startTime":"19:44","endTime":"19:48","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Yeah.","startTime":"19:48","endTime":"19:49","speaker_name":"David

nature.","startTime":"19:56","endTime":"20:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Then you're using the LLMs to provide this theory of human

here.","startTime":"20:21","endTime":"20:30","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And, you know, when we did our design Sprints in California, most of a lot of people were

Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"That's a thing.","startTime":"45:24","endTime":"45:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So the other side of it is, well, those rules aren't working for everybody.","startTime":"45:25","endTime":"45:28","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so do two things.","startTime":"45:29","endTime":"45:31","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"You have the rules, like, we have the 30 minutes and then you have the period of, okay,

Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"It's.","startTime":"47:30","endTime":"47:30","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's an inquiry.","startTime":"47:31","endTime":"47:31","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And so I put what.","startTime":"47:31","endTime":"47:33","speaker_name":"David

there.","startTime":"47:40","endTime":"47:42","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"But it is an interesting thing to be able to say, what do I.","startTime":"47:43","endTime":"47:47","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Want out of my next meeting more.","startTime":"47:47","endTime":"47:50","speaker_name":"David

that.","startTime":"48:16","endTime":"48:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But it's an opportunity to figure

Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I was going to say, is it like a powerful thing that maybe these agents are taking context from a meeting and like giving people feedback?","startTime":"49:47","endTime":"49:56","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Say somebody does a presentation in a meeting like this, they done like Hannah done is his

Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Yep.","startTime":"50:11","endTime":"50:11","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so having a structure at the front side allows for the agenda set up.","startTime":"50:12","endTime":"50:15","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And say, we need one agent to do this part.","startTime":"50:15","endTime":"50:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"50:18","endTime":"50:18","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"He can have all these different frameworks to make all these perspectives happen.","startTime":"50:18","endTime":"50:21","speaker_name":"David

answers?","startTime":"50:23","endTime":"50:24","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"50:24","endTime":"50:25","speaker_name":"David

doing right now.","startTime":"50:31","endTime":"50:32","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Or, you know, so making up a bunch of rules saying, we want these kind of.","startTime":"50:33","endTime":"50:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We're curious about this.","startTime":"50:36","endTime":"50:38","speaker_name":"David

Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's how you process.","startTime":"51:27","endTime":"51:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"And the fact that there's a lack of processing going on and there's more capabilities to process is where I look at things.","startTime":"51:29","endTime":"51:35","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And yeah, it started my mornings mostly with note taking because it is a different modality and does set things up differently.","startTime":"51:35","endTime":"51:42","speaker_name":"David

Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And so I kind of very curious about that.","startTime":"54:14","endTime":"54:18","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But that's very emergent.","startTime":"54:18","endTime":"54:20","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"It's an emergent property.","startTime":"54:20","endTime":"54:21","speaker_name":"Hanif

that.","startTime":"54:23","endTime":"54:37","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But I think the idea of integrating an AI agent, this agentic piece of conversational

some.","startTime":"55:34","endTime":"55:37","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Because of the conversation, especially that Folio has mentioned, I think there's some real curious things to get to.","startTime":"55:37","endTime":"55:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And one of them is the get past the collection

things will be interesting.","startTime":"56:07","endTime":"56:09","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"But I mean, like, keeping the conversations going, having the meetings, you know, building the corpus.","startTime":"56:10","endTime":"56:14","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You know, it's all.","startTime":"56:14","endTime":"56:15","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's strange that this dynamic where it changes, like meetings feel like most meetings that I

outcomes.","startTime":"56:17","endTime":"56:33","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But a lot of time in meetings like you're kind of like just keeping information moving and

Ciano","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Because I do see meetings sometimes as being like, if.","startTime":"57:03","endTime":"57:06","speaker_name":"Fulvio Ciano","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"If that becomes a habit, you know, like there's this information exchange without a result or a product or an output or more importantly, what you meant went into the meeting wanting to get out.","startTime":"57:06","endTime":"57:16","speaker_name":"Fulvio Ciano","speaker_id":5},{"sentence":"Right.","startTime":"57:16","endTime":"57:17","speaker_name":"David

right.","startTime":"57:25","endTime":"57:25","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Well, I think.","startTime":"57:25","endTime":"57:27","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Let me be explicit.","startTime":"57:28","endTime":"57:29","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like, I guess my meetings are different because I'm pretty clear on, like, what I want out of my meetings, but I attend a lot of other people's meetings and they kind of had like a standing meeting.","startTime":"57:29","endTime":"57:38","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like maybe two departments have a meeting together or something, and they just.","startTime":"57:39","endTime":"57:43","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"They just don't quite know what they want, but they're trying to talk into it.","startTime":"57:43","endTime":"57:47","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's usually like some information exchange and then maybe some brainstorming happens kind of naturally, but that's not like an objective.","startTime":"57:47","endTime":"57:54","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so they try to jam things together and they don't know how to do it.","startTime":"57:55","endTime":"57:58","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So they just say, like, all These people in a room and like, maybe we'll figure it out.","startTime":"57:58","endTime":"58:02","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But then that thing gets.","startTime":"58:02","endTime":"58:03","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It catches some sort of, I guess, momentum, and it just keeps staying in the calendar every week.","startTime":"58:03","endTime":"58:08","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then it keeps happening.","startTime":"58:08","endTime":"58:09","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It keeps happening.","startTime":"58:09","endTime":"58:10","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's happening, but it's not actually getting at the resolution or the outcome that they're trying to achieve.","startTime":"58:10","endTime":"58:15","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I kind of find it fascinating that people use meetings as a means to try and get movement on something, but if it's not well structured in terms of what they're trying to actually achieve, then it just ends up sucking up air.","startTime":"58:16","endTime":"58:30","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yeah, but the whole thing is like, you could operate with like a handful of meetings very effectively and that could be the entire job if you had that design appropriate.","startTime":"58:31","endTime":"58:41","speaker_name":"Jason Kryski","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"If you, if you have that in mind.","startTime":"58:42","endTime":"58:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I'm reminded of a guy I met.","startTime":"58:43","endTime":"58:44","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"In Squamish who works in a company that has 200,000 people now, and he works in cross functional

all the information across.","startTime":"58:52","endTime":"58:58","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Two departments to build this report because he wanted to see some stuff.","startTime":"58:58","endTime":"59:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And 20 years or some great number of years after this person left, they keep building this report because they're not.","startTime":"59:02","endTime":"59:08","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Sure who works with it and what value it has.","startTime":"59:08","endTime":"59:10","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And to stop it actually takes effort.","startTime":"59:10","endTime":"59:13","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because the organization is large enough, they have a process for that.","startTime":"59:14","endTime":"59:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"So it's like Brazil, the movie, which I guess is 40 years older.","startTime":"59:20","endTime":"59:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":3},{"sentence":"Yeah, it's pretty old now, but I thought that's like the nth degree
