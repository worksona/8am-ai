right?","startTime":"05:25","endTime":"05:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"You can go peering around and because you can scrape anything that's out in the public domain,

we'll eventually have to figure out.","startTime":"05:59","endTime":"06:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But the idea being that what we're.","startTime":"06:06","endTime":"06:09","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Saying in here is what we have amongst ourselves and then there's a practicality.","startTime":"06:09","endTime":"06:14","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Of sharing it which will have to have some permissions based.","startTime":"06:14","endTime":"06:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"All that thing is great.","startTime":"06:18","endTime":"06:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I believe in the people and then.","startTime":"06:23","endTime":"06:26","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Yes, we'll have to ask for credentials.","startTime":"06:26","endTime":"06:28","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I think most people are on.","startTime":"06:28","endTime":"06:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"GitHub so that makes things easy.","startTime":"06:29","endTime":"06:31","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And if they're not, then that's a hurdle.","startTime":"06:32","endTime":"06:34","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"But I was just displaying how I.","startTime":"06:35","endTime":"06:37","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Was using the MCP inside Claude to get summaries of our last discussion and that was just me filling the air and also I Ying, I was reiterating that the summary that you gave last week is essentially the consent that we.","startTime":"06:37","endTime":"06:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Give.","startTime":"06:57","endTime":"06:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And then, and then that's nothing changes and then the people are the people.","startTime":"07:00","endTime":"07:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And so today's topics weren't really anything more than that.","startTime":"07:06","endTime":"07:11","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"Introducing the fact that the discussion was yet another demonstration and it resulted in a full circle but we had it and open and that was one of the cooler sessions I think we had.","startTime":"07:11","endTime":"07:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And as Jason said he wished his partner was there.","startTime":"07:23","endTime":"07:26","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And I know that I don't think Jen can make it today but that's a jam.","startTime":"07:26","endTime":"07:31","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"So I could see this like oh my God, I just need to, I need to.","startTime":"07:32","endTime":"07:36","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Oh there's Jen.","startTime":"07:36","endTime":"07:36","speaker_name":"David

here.","startTime":"07:37","endTime":"07:39","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it was all around great thing and I guess in some way I'll communicate what James had summarized in an email between myself, Jason and James just in a personal conversation and that'll be the end of that consent discussion and then what to do with it is always really cool and I'll just.","startTime":"07:40","endTime":"08:04","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I pointed to.","startTime":"08:04","endTime":"08:06","speaker_name":"David

you.","startTime":"43:50","endTime":"43:52","speaker_name":"Ying","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"It's the way they interact and the behavior predict what they're gonna

right?","startTime":"46:57","endTime":"47:00","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And to the point, it's not like something like, and I always go back biomed, like a medical

really diving into values and ethics.","startTime":"47:38","endTime":"47:43","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And there's no one
