you have the background for it is great.","startTime":"04:34","endTime":"04:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think that's why the large language models are really

interesting.","startTime":"08:36","endTime":"08:42","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"And yeah, maybe a rotating thing.","startTime":"08:42","endTime":"08:45","speaker_name":"James Giroday","speaker_id":0},{"sentence":"I mean, you wouldn't want to put that all one person, that's for

whatever.","startTime":"10:08","endTime":"10:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the constraints on are fairly similar.","startTime":"10:17","endTime":"10:20","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I was able to build what I call a learning ladder without any effort, just riffing and

different browser histories.","startTime":"23:56","endTime":"23:58","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And even the AI, like I'll

good job of what agents will do.","startTime":"26:47","endTime":"26:52","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that is they will have a constrained set of what they have as a

it's easy to jump the gate, but right now it's really difficult to do that with the tools.","startTime":"27:12","endTime":"27:22","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you are being.","startTime":"27:22","endTime":"27:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Your practice is like if we document this, it is the best compliant practice for agents and how they would operate in their own browser, in their own way.","startTime":"27:24","endTime":"27:35","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And just to be sure about things, there's an easy solution for you.","startTime":"27:36","endTime":"27:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You just try out Manus, it'll jump on top of anything and then you can provide rules as to which browser you use for which one, for all the activities anyways, there's ways for you to jump the gate programmatically, but because you haven't, you've made it such a difficult thing for yourself even cognitively.","startTime":"27:40","endTime":"27:55","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You spend time to make sure that you separate things.","startTime":"27:55","endTime":"27:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And that's a really big thing.","startTime":"27:58","endTime":"28:00","speaker_name":"David

highlights kind of where people are at in terms of they've set stuff up like this.","startTime":"28:12","endTime":"28:19","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Now you have to retool with the new tools to like to make it easier and take advantage of capabilities that are now there that weren't.","startTime":"28:19","endTime":"28:30","speaker_name":"Jen

the agent going to behave unfailingly the way I need it to?","startTime":"28:34","endTime":"28:39","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"And if you're not sure, then you're just like, no, I'm going to bend things.","startTime":"28:40","endTime":"28:44","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"How about, how about you've Put gen in the loop on the gen loop, like

the desk project we could try and do.","startTime":"29:00","endTime":"29:04","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"We simulate.","startTime":"29:05","endTime":"29:06","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Jen and I think one part of it is context, right?","startTime":"29:06","endTime":"29:09","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because a lot of the context is in my brain about some tasks that it's not clear which window to go to unless you know the context.","startTime":"29:09","endTime":"29:20","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So that's one question too that I'm going to throw out there.","startTime":"29:21","endTime":"29:23","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"My last not two minute long thought is like, how, you know, I think everyone struggles with this.","startTime":"29:23","endTime":"29:30","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"How do you get enough context to accurately do the task when so much of it is implicit in the user's brain, you know, to make it.","startTime":"29:30","endTime":"29:42","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Where's that sweet spot of like explicitly expressing all the context that an agent needs to do a good job?","startTime":"29:42","endTime":"29:50","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"Because without it, you know, the agent has to guess.","startTime":"29:50","endTime":"29:53","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"I think that's a tricky one.","startTime":"29:55","endTime":"29:57","speaker_name":"Jen Boger","speaker_id":2},{"sentence":"So I'm interested in that topic if anyone, you know, is okay, wants to.","startTime":"29:57","endTime":"30:03","speaker_name":"Jen

bit.","startTime":"30:15","endTime":"30:18","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"I, I think I came to all of this really sideways, which I think I do a lot.","startTime":"30:18","endTime":"30:24","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But I came into this kind of arena after reading some interesting book by Robin Sloan called Moonbound.","startTime":"30:26","endTime":"30:35","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And this idea of a distributed intelligence that is AI, but takes many forms seemed really very cool.","startTime":"30:36","endTime":"30:46","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And I think for me the comfort rung that you talked about is very much conversational and what that brings in terms of perspective to problems or ideas or thoughts that I'm considering.","startTime":"30:46","endTime":"31:03","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And as a kind of conversational partner, it becomes quite interesting to play with.","startTime":"31:04","endTime":"31:13","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So I listening to the conversation today, I don't think I get caught in the weeds.","startTime":"31:14","endTime":"31:20","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"I don't, because I'm not trying to make it a tool of productivity or enhance something, nor am I trying to use it to code or solve.","startTime":"31:20","endTime":"31:30","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And in that way I think it works pretty well as a kind of a mirror to engage thoughts and ideas and explore possibilities.","startTime":"31:33","endTime":"31:43","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And so it's more like an investigative tool, a bit of a sandbox.","startTime":"31:44","endTime":"31:51","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And.","startTime":"31:53","endTime":"31:54","speaker_name":"David

with it.","startTime":"31:55","endTime":"31:58","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And I'm sure it gets very complicated very quickly, as we've seen here.","startTime":"31:59","endTime":"32:05","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"When.","startTime":"32:07","endTime":"32:07","speaker_name":"David

significant.","startTime":"32:07","endTime":"32:16","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"But as a sort of high altitude Play arena around distributed intelligence.","startTime":"32:17","endTime":"32:29","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"It seems pretty cool to me.","startTime":"32:29","endTime":"32:31","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Can I, can I ask.","startTime":"32:32","endTime":"32:33","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I've been a part of conversations with you all through that path and how you've applied some maps and I appreciate how you've come in and your positioning on that.","startTime":"32:33","endTime":"32:44","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I would suggest that everybody has a learning roadmap that they would have applied to even the same understanding of emissaries and interstellar space.","startTime":"32:44","endTime":"32:51","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Meaning that some don't work, man.","startTime":"32:53","endTime":"32:55","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I find that really phenomenal because, you know, I've worked with algorithms and I actually work to get them to break so I can see what the algorithm means.","startTime":"32:58","endTime":"33:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I think a lot of this room has done that and they explore it and they call it these technical things.","startTime":"33:05","endTime":"33:09","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But if I use that word, corrupt, I'm sure you've run into some cruft and you're like, I know you've jumped a few times on this, man, so you're being super generous because I think you're on a good wave.","startTime":"33:10","endTime":"33:20","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But in terms of the learning, I think you've taught me more about how to systematize thinking around that shit than most people.","startTime":"33:21","endTime":"33:31","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, I don't know if I did.","startTime":"33:31","endTime":"33:34","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"That, but what I'm getting to do is I'm trying to get you to redirect around the things.","startTime":"33:34","endTime":"33:38","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like this is what I look at, like really high level.","startTime":"33:38","endTime":"33:41","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But in terms of, if we look at even just the notion of prompting, like there's things like being clear that we talked about providing context, breaking things down, using examples, you've.","startTime":"33:41","endTime":"33:51","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Because of your curiosity around the level of psychology and spirituality and connection, you probably found some pretty good limits on this stuff.","startTime":"33:51","endTime":"34:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Well, you know, this is, I think, actually really kind of cool because.","startTime":"34:03","endTime":"34:07","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"It.","startTime":"34:08","endTime":"34:09","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Is through the prompting and the kind of engagement with the AI.","startTime":"34:09","endTime":"34:13","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So what I think is super interesting is the relational kind of conversation.","startTime":"34:13","endTime":"34:23","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So we tend not to engage with the AI as a, in a relational way.","startTime":"34:23","endTime":"34:30","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And I think when you do, the results are actually way more interesting and valuable as feedback.","startTime":"34:30","endTime":"34:38","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"So if there's one takeaway, that might be it.","startTime":"34:40","endTime":"34:43","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"Yeah, that is.","startTime":"34:44","endTime":"34:45","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I have a higher level set of objectives for learning.","startTime":"34:45","endTime":"34:49","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And stage three or stage two is partnering.","startTime":"34:49","endTime":"34:52","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Just recognizing you can't ask it to do everything, you can't ask for it to do nothing from, from everything.","startTime":"34:52","endTime":"34:59","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you can't go from everything to nothing.","startTime":"34:59","endTime":"35:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you can have this conversational nature to it.","startTime":"35:02","endTime":"35:05","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Right?","startTime":"35:05","endTime":"35:05","speaker_name":"David

that way.","startTime":"35:16","endTime":"35:17","speaker_name":"Hanif Janmohamed","speaker_id":4},{"sentence":"And you know, we talked for

functional.","startTime":"40:08","endTime":"40:12","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then put them into like 15 descriptions that are functional.","startTime":"40:12","endTime":"40:16","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And then just say, throw them at this corpus or this idea or this conversation and it will

this stuff, but it's a paradigm, it's way of thinking.","startTime":"40:51","endTime":"41:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And you know how the playground came out?","startTime":"41:00","endTime":"41:04","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like Steve Jobs wasn't Steve Jobs, it was Wozniak.","startTime":"41:04","endTime":"41:11","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And what was the other guy's name who did all the software.","startTime":"41:11","endTime":"41:13","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Do you guys remember HyperCard?","startTime":"41:16","endTime":"41:17","speaker_name":"David

programming.","startTime":"41:20","endTime":"41:26","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Anyways, HyperCard was a programming so called scripting high level language to work in the Apple environment to build hypertextual documentation.","startTime":"41:26","endTime":"41:37","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But it had a card analogy.","startTime":"41:37","endTime":"41:38","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the first thing you learned is that the card analogy was bunk and you had to get past that quickly.","startTime":"41:38","endTime":"41:42","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But the card analogy is wonderful and we use it all the time in software.","startTime":"41:42","endTime":"41:46","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"We use it everywhere.","startTime":"41:46","endTime":"41:47","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so the playground is just the card analogy played out.","startTime":"41:47","endTime":"41:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Each of these is just a prompt or a Persona or a scenario and it just runs them from left to right.","startTime":"41:50","endTime":"41:58","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it's like I was like, what is the simplest metaphor I could come up with?","startTime":"41:59","endTime":"42:04","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I did a whole lot of sideways analysis.","startTime":"42:04","endTime":"42:07","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Like they're talking about taking a whole lot of different things and trying to understand different patterns in which things could apply.","startTime":"42:07","endTime":"42:13","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it first started with what you're talking about, James, is like you can do more parallel thinking than you possibly can with the AI.","startTime":"42:13","endTime":"42:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's just there's no interface for it.","startTime":"42:21","endTime":"42:22","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And why I'm bringing up the playground right now, it still has really, you know, it still has UX problems, it still has all kinds of shit problems with it.","startTime":"42:23","endTime":"42:30","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"The reason I went back and I introduced the ability to chat your own playground is because it still has both parallel and sequential warp flow orchestration built into it.","startTime":"42:30","endTime":"42:40","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"You can do it yourself or you can have it and chat it now.","startTime":"42:40","endTime":"42:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And it has all of these specialized workflows built into it now, from technology to healthcare tracking to financial to consulting.","startTime":"42:44","endTime":"42:54","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I built one for us, it's called Curiosity Cohort.","startTime":"42:54","endTime":"42:57","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So you can drop transcripts into it and analyze it from like a bunch of different points of view.","startTime":"42:58","endTime":"43:01","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It's kind of weak still.","startTime":"43:01","endTime":"43:02","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"It doesn't have all the teeth we do, but that's why we have our transcripts.","startTime":"43:02","endTime":"43:06","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I think that point of view is super powerful if you can find a way of carrying through with it the parallelism, the ability to analyze more than you can on your own with AI.","startTime":"43:06","endTime":"43:20","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But I'm not seeing it, man, I'm not seeing it except for anecdotally and the ability to do it themselves.","startTime":"43:20","endTime":"43:27","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm not seeing it systematically unless I'm seeing or hearing about it at an enterprise level.","startTime":"43:28","endTime":"43:35","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I'm not seeing it outside this room where people are doing multiple things to analyze a situation and then say this is the best strategic path.","startTime":"43:35","endTime":"43:43","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And I'm not finding anyone in business who gives a about it man.","startTime":"43:46","endTime":"43:50","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I'm swearing triple there because I'm trying to stop swearing but I'm quite like what we can do is incredible.","startTime":"43:51","endTime":"44:00","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"What we can tell people is possible is on point.","startTime":"44:00","endTime":"44:03","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And the fact that we can scale ourselves as small teams to deliver in big ways is really cool.","startTime":"44:04","endTime":"44:10","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"But you need somebody on the other side that will believe in the same sort of line of thinking.","startTime":"44:10","endTime":"44:14","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And to illustrate that is very difficult.","startTime":"44:15","endTime":"44:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So I'm going down the path of trying to understand what it means to educate at a distance, to have our clients upskill before they get to us.","startTime":"44:17","endTime":"44:23","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so I appreciate your conversation around learning and what it means individually because I'm not going to spend any more time with prospects in the same way I have in assessing their sense of where they're at to upskill their ability to push us down the road as a decision point.","startTime":"44:24","endTime":"44:47","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"And so learning is a really significant part of this AI curve and how to keep a fundamental perspective on things like the simplicity of a card metaphor or the idea of a relationship driving business is a, is an interesting one.","startTime":"44:48","endTime":"45:08","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"Spencer and Graham, you guys are focusing on that component of the relationship side of things.","startTime":"45:12","endTime":"45:16","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I do want to talk to you about that.","startTime":"45:16","endTime":"45:17","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"I make sure that we don't have that in my stuff.","startTime":"45:18","endTime":"45:21","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"So if I'm thinking about my entry Point into AI, it definitely was driven.","startTime":"45:24","endTime":"45:29","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I think since 2019 I've been like journaling and using that as a tool for self reflection.","startTime":"45:30","endTime":"45:35","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And then when I started using ChatGPT, maybe 2023, it definitely like I have a system where I basically have every single journal entry I've ever written down in actual system I can use.","startTime":"45:36","endTime":"45:53","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I don't bring those all over into ChatGPT, but just the idea that I can dialogue about my own personality, my own character, my own psychology and get immediate feedback.","startTime":"45:54","endTime":"46:09","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"You know, it's been like a game changer in terms of not just understanding who I am, but choosing the identity that I want to create for myself and really understanding that I'm capable of that.","startTime":"46:10","endTime":"46:26","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"I'm capable of choosing my values, understanding my values and living life the way I want to and a dialogue where I get immediate feedback about how I can do that effectively is something I get from ChatGPT.","startTime":"46:26","endTime":"46:39","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And it's just been very powerful in terms of that understanding over time.","startTime":"46:39","endTime":"46:45","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Another thing that I realized very early on was just the meta, like, I guess the meta learning opportunity that dialogue presented.","startTime":"46:46","endTime":"46:58","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Like, I realized very early on, like, I think I pitched this to Spencer.","startTime":"46:58","endTime":"47:03","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"He wasn't interested in it, but I came up with some like, idea for a platform that was like, basically adapting to individuals learning styles in real time because everyone learns differently.","startTime":"47:03","endTime":"47:20","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And like, as I was dialoguing with ChatGPT and as I was like working through whatever like major intellectual challenges I had, I was really realizing exactly how I learned or exactly how I best learn certain types of information.","startTime":"47:20","endTime":"47:35","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"So sometimes it makes more sense for me to visualize something or to like, structure it in a way where I'm like, identifying the most critical variables and then like have it in a visual and that's how I'm going to learn that subject.","startTime":"47:36","endTime":"47:48","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And if there was a tool that understood that well and could take information and then make it interpretable to me in the way that I'm going to understand it best, that's just seemed very powerful.","startTime":"47:49","endTime":"48:02","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"Seems very powerful.","startTime":"48:02","endTime":"48:03","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"And that was definitely something that came out of my explorations with just dialoguing with ChatGPT.","startTime":"48:04","endTime":"48:11","speaker_name":"Graham Fawcett","speaker_id":7},{"sentence":"But I think fundamentally for me, like, the way I use it is identity creation and identity reinforcement and like self reflection.","startTime":"48:12","endTime":"48:23","speaker_name":"Graham

level.","startTime":"49:28","endTime":"49:29","speaker_name":"David Olsson","speaker_id":1},{"sentence":"That's not like, oh, I need to understand the problem really
